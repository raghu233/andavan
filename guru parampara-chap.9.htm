The Astrologers who looked at the horoscope of swAmi predicted that he would
become a sanyAsi and a parama virakthA,unparalleled. After undergoing samskArams
at the right age, swAmi performed adhyayanam of sAma sAkhA and became an
exponent. He underwent rigorous training and mastered sanskrit, and Kavya
sAstrAs along with other vEda sAkhAs in Thirukkudanthai Sanskrit College. He
went to Rajamannar koil<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>nd mastered
vyAkaraNa sAstrAs under the tutelage of Sri. U.Ve. RangachAr swAmi (This mahAn
later became the 39th Jeer of Sri Ahobila Mutt as Sri Parankusa SatakOpa
yatheendra mahA dEsikan). Later he went to viLAkkudi to learn tharka sAstrAs
under the eminent guidance of “ThArkika simham” Sri. U.Ve. SrinivAsachariAr
swAmi. Having completely learnt tharka sAstrAs, swAmi learnt and mastered
MeemAmsa sAstrAs under the guidance of MahA mahOpAdhyAyA Brahmasri KuppuswAmi
SastrigAL and Brahmasri ChinnaswAmi SastrigAL. <o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Comic Sans MS'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In
the year 1908, swAmi was married to Srimathi Vijayavalli Ammal. Immediately
after the marriage, swAmi took the VaisvadEva upadEsam from his paternal uncle,
Maha vidwAn Brahmanidhi Sri. U.Ve. RamabhadrAchAr swAmi. During his
GruhasthAsramA, swAmi observed panca kAla anushtAnams in an austere and rigorous
way. Later, swAmi served as a religious teacher in a national high school. .
During this time swAmi served as an examiner for sanskrit competitions conducted
Sri kanchi kAmakOti matam. Sri SankarAchArya (paramAchAryA) had utmost respect
for swAmi’s pAndithyAm.<br>
<br>
SwAmi followed Sriman nigamAntha mahA dEsikan in observing ‘Unccha vrutthi’.
Such was the vairAghyam swAmi possessed in renouncement all the materialistic
lifestyle and observance of severe austerity. c.. SwAmi underwent grantha
chathushtya kAlakshEpams under Srimath NammAndavan. In the kAlakshEpa goshti,
swAmi used to listen to kAlakshEpam with rapt attention and full concentration.<br>
Srimath NammAndavan performed panca samskAram to swAmi in his younger days and
later performed bharasamarpanam at the lotus feet of vaduvoor (Lord Sri Rama).
In the year 1922, in Mannargudi,Sri Ramanaya upanyasam of swAmi was arranged by
Sri. U.Ve. vidwAn Rama swAmi Iyengar and Sri. U.Ve. KrishnamAchAriAr,which went
on for over two months.<br>
While swAmi was undertaking kAlakshEpams from His Holiness Srimath NammAndavan ,Srimath
Andavan adorned ThirunAdu unexpectedly in Kanchipuram. Srimath Akkur Andavan
succeeded NammAndavan to adorn the AchArya peetam. Thembarai swAmi continued his
kAlakshEpams under Srimath Akkur Andavan.</span></p>

Guna seelA<br>
From his younger days, swAmi was a puritan filled with all satva gunAs ..
Simplicity, honesty, purity, veracity, courage, equality, renunciation, lucid
and profound<br>
sampradayic knowledge were hallmarks of swAmi’s gunAs. One could see
simplicity all the way in the clothes he wore, the food he ate or the lifestyle
he led. SwAmi was such a down-to-earth person who won the respect of many of his
admirers SwAmi had no desire to save money for his family. The amazing virakthi
swAmi possessed is attributed to his profound knowledge of our siddhAnta and
total belief in it. Even during the sadas when sambhavana was offered to vidwAns,
swAmi would do his best to avoid taking up sanmAnam.<br>
<br>
SanyAsa sweekAram<br>
Swami was doing kainkaryam to Srimath Akkur Andavan, continuing to undertake
kAlakshEpams under His Holiness. Srimath Andavan was immensely pleased with our
swAmi’s GnAna, vairAghyA and AnushtAnams and felt that our swami was the right
person to be adorned as ‘sampradAya pravarthakA’ of periAsramam after His
time.HE WAS very <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>confident our
swami would carry Asramam’s growth to heights of glory. Accordingly HH did
upadEsam on prapatti proyOgA and prEsha manthram to our swami.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, swAmi’s dharma patni attained AchAryan thiruvadi in the year
1946. Srimath Akkur Andavan was also becoming weak because of age. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Swami
after long thoughts decided to take up sanyAsam and hence went to Srimath
Andavan and prayed to HH and sought his blessings for the sanyAsam. Srimath
Andavan was extremely pleased by swAmi’s decision and ordained His sishyAs to
make arrangements for the Holy ceremony.<br>
<br>
In the year viya in the month of Aippasi on the 21<sup>st</sup> day i.e. on
6-10-1946 in the presence of several Andavan Thiruvadis, Srimath Akkur Andavan
gave the holy sanyAsam to Sri. U.Ve. Brahmaniddhi Thembarai
VenkatarAghavAchAriar swami. He was given the title as ‘Sri RanganAtha mahA
dEsikan’ and was fondly called as Thembarai Andavan. Srimath Akkur Andavan
lived for 5 more months after that and adorned ThirunAdu on 19-3-1947 on a
krishna paksha dwAdasi day ( in the month of Panguni, viya year). <o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Comic Sans MS'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Because
of the sanyAsa sweekAram, swami's lifestyle did not change a bit at all as he
practiced a life of sanyAsi even before that with rigorous anushtAnams and
extreme vairAghyam having completely renounced worldly comforts.<br>
The daily chores of Asramam was maintained the same way as it was done from
Srimath PeriAndavan's period. Srimath Thembarai Andavan would wake up before 4
AM in the morning and would perform avagAha snAnam immediately thereafter.
SandhyAvandhanam, japams would be done after that followed by bhagavath
ArAdhanam and purvAchAryAs' pAdukA ArAdhanam. This was followed by distribution
of perumAl and pAdukA theertham. . Later, Sri bhAshya, geethA bhAshya, bhagavath
vishaya kAlakshEpams would by rendered by His Holiness after which vaidheeka
karmas such as samAsrayanams and bharanyAsams would be performed for the
bhAgavathAs for the day.<o:p>

</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Comic Sans MS'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><br>
In the evenings, kAlakshEpams on divya sookthis such as Srimath RamAyanam, nyAya
siddhAnjanam. AdhikaraNa sArAvaLi would happen besides other anushtAnams.
Srimath Andavan would consume very little food once a day in the mornings. <o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Comic Sans MS'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><br>
During swAmi's time as AchAryA, Sri. U.Ve. Chakravarthi KrishnamAchAriar swAmi,
Sri. U.Ve. V.K. SrinivAsAchAriAr swami and later Sri. U.Ve. SrinivAsa
rAghavAchariAr swami ( Kannan swami – later Srimath Thirukkudanthai Andavan)
served as Sri Karyams of Asramam at different periods.<o:p>

As per the holy order of His Holiness, a monthly magazine called 'Sri Ranganatha
Paduka' was started in the year 1955 in the month of October ( Manmatha Varusham
in the month of Ippasi) to bring a connection between the asramam and the
andavan sishyas.<br>
<br>
Srimath Thembarai Andavan became weaker as the days passed by due to rigorous
anushtanams, meagre intake of food and also due to breathing related health
issues. His Holiness gave upadEsam on “PrEsha manthram” and “MOkshAsrama
Ahnika AnushtAnam” to three vidwAns of the Asramam - U.Ve. Sri. </span><span lang="DE" style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Comic Sans MS'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: DE">Kannan

GopAlAchAr swAmi(who later on became Srimath Mysore Andavan in the late 80s) and
Mannargudi GanapAdi vidwAn U.Ve. Sri. NarasimhAchArya swAmi for them to be ready
and take up sanyAsam any time when called.<br>
<br>
In April 1963, Srimath Andavan’s health was extremely affected and with great
difficulty His Holiness was performing his nithya karma anushtAnamOn April 4th
1963, Srimath Andavan's condition became worse and most of the sishyAs were
informed. Sree kAryam Sri. U.Ve. kannan swAmi was also informed of Srimath
Andavan’s health and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>. On His
arrival, arrangements were speeded up for Sri kannan swAmi's thureeyAsrama
sweekAram. Early morning the next day i.e. on 5th april, 1963 (Friday, sukla
dwAdasi, makam star), in the presence of sishyAs, His Holiness Srimath Thembarai
Andavan ordained the ascetic order to Sri U.Ve. Kannan SwAmi who was named as
Srimath vEdAnta rAmAnuja mahA dEsikan. and within few hours on the same day
(April 5th 1963) He adorned Thirunadu satisfied with having found His worthy
successor. <o:p>
