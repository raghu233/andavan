poorattadhi is the thirunakshatram of Srimath ThErazhundur Andavan Sri Vedhantha
Ramanuja Mahadesikan. His poorvashrama Name was Sri Varadhachar. Sri Varadhachar
Swami was born in the year Prajothpathi (1871) in the month of AvaNi in
ThErazhundur village in Tanjore district in Tamilnadu. He belonged to Eyunni
vamsam and Bharadwaja Gothram. At very early age, he was trained at vedha
adhyayanam, kavyam and nataka alankaram at his birth place. To learn TharkA,
vyAkaranA, and meemAmsA he went to Srirangam, offered his obeisance at the feet
of PeriAndavan who in turn blessed Sri VaradhAchar swami with pancha samskaram
and manthra upadesam. Sri VaradAchAr swami learnt Tharka and nyAya sAsthrA from
the great scholar Vilakkudi Vedhanthachar swAmi. He under went intensive
training under the great pandit pudhu-agrahAram Brahmasri Kuppuswami sastrigal
in meemAmsA and vyakaranA. He had performed Atma samarpanam at the holy feet of
Nam Perumal by Srimath ChinnAndavan - Srimath Paduka Sevaka Ramanuja Maha
Desikan.<br style="mso-special-character: line-break">

. Sri Varadhachar swami became a disciple at the holy feet of Srimath
ChinnAndavan - Srimath PAdukA Sevaka Ramanuja Maha Desikan and learnt kalakshEpa
grantha chathushtyams from His Holiness, His Holiness Srimath Chinnandavan who
was very much impressed with Sri VaradhAchar Swami called him one day and told,
&quot;You are going to be the Sampradhaya Pravarthaka of this Asramam&quot; .
When Srimath Chinnandavan's health was affected, he longed for a successor for
this sampradhaya. Sri VaradAchAr swami, at that young age readily offered
himself for the ascetic order. But some concerns were raised from very close
circle of Varadhachar swamy. HH adorned thirunadu in Vijaya varusham (1894) in
the month of thai without appointing a successor to Asramam. Sri VaradAchAr
swami, after completion of Chinnandavan's kainkaryams, purchased a house at
Srirangam and lived there with his parents and wife. He visited the Brindavanam
of asramam daily, performed ThiruvArAdhanam, and pAdukArAdhanam in morning and
offered ThiruviLakku at evening and after all kainkaryams, he used to return
home only at night. <o:p>

was his daily activity for 11 long years from Vijaya varusham 1884 Thai month to
Visuvavasu-Avani -1905, when 76 years old Kadanthethi SathavadhAnam Varadha
vEdhanthAchAr swami, a disciple of PeriAndavan, was requested by all Andavan
Ashramam sishyas and other bhagavathas to take up sanyasam from Thirukkudanthai
Srimath Azhagiya singar. . Accordingly Srimath Srinivasa SatakOpa Yatheendra
Maha Desikan (38th Jeer of Sri Ahoibila Mutt) who was camping at Nrusimhapuram
gave thureeyAsramam to Kadanthethi swAmi in presence of a large Srivaishvaite
gathering. Thus 76 year old KAdanthethi swami became the Asrama Head of Srimath
Andavan periAsramam as Srinivasa RAmAnuja MahA DEsikan.<br style="mso-special-character: line-break">

health of KAdanthEthi Andavan deteriorated during 1905 and all asramam sishyas
immediately rushed to Sri VaradAchar swami and requested to take up sanyasam
from KAdanthEthi Andavan. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Sri
VaradAchAr swAmi readily acceded to their request by leaving the family to take
up ascetic orders. He received thureeyAsramam from the holy hands of KadanthEthi
Andavan Srinivasa Ramanuja Maha Desikan in the year KEELAKA VARUSHAM- AVANI
MADHAM (sep-oct ,1908 ) and was named Sri VEdAntha RAmAnuja MahA dEsikan- also
known as &amp; ThErazhundur Andavan. And NammAndavan. Both AchAryAs were
together for a period of 6 months. Srimath KadanthEthi Andavan attained

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Comic Sans MS'">Ever
since Srimath NammAndavan took up sanyasam, His Holiness had assimilated in
himself strict austerity, extreme rigid and rigorous routines of a sanyAsi,
leading a highly puritan's life of his poorvacharyas, rejecting all luxuries and
conveniences. He travelled by walk only like his predecessors observing &quot;
pAdhayAthra&quot; to visit holy shrines. Good personality, majestic look,
pleasing voice, convincing talk etc were his great traits. His discourses were
full of humor , with penetrating perception of holy life of sages Alwars and
ArchAvathAras. He attracted all sections of vaishnavite community, vedic
scholars and VEdhAnthis, by his philosophic lectures. His deliverance of Sri
BAshyA, Bhagavath vishyam and other granthAs, were with such ease and
perfection, that they attracted a large gathering around him, wherever he
lectured. People in those days used to say that, Peria perumal is namm Perumal,
jewel among alwars - is nammAlwAr and jewel among acharyas- is NammAndavan . <o:p>
