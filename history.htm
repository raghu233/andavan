<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="5">1.&nbsp; Thirukkudanthai
Desikan (Sri Gopalarya Mahadesikan)</font> </strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="5">2.&nbsp; Sri Vazhuthur
Andavan (Sri Vedantha Ramanuja Mahadesikan)</font></strong></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3">The&nbsp;&nbsp; Institution&nbsp;&nbsp; had &nbsp;&nbsp;
its&nbsp;&nbsp; genesis&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; Sri Gopalarya Mahadesikan famously
known as Thirukkudanthai Desikan. He was born about three hundred years ago, in the
village of Rayampettai in the district of Thanjavur by the Grace of Lord Oppiliappan as
the son of Krishnasuri. He became proficient in all scriptures at a young age. He was sent
by his father to Srirangam to be a disciple of Sri Sakshat Swami who was Himself very
famous from the day of His birth. In fact Lord Ranganatha instructed Sri Sakshat Swami in
his dream to train Sri Gopaladesika in the philosophical tradition propagated by Sri
Ramanuja and Sri Vedanta Desika.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3">On a command received from Lord Aravamudha of
Thirukkudanthai, Sri Gopaladesikan, returned to Thirukkudanthai and started propagating
the sampradayam (traditional religious doctrine)&nbsp; besides&nbsp; completing&nbsp; the
&nbsp; books&nbsp; which were left unfinished by his Acharyas. He himself &nbsp;&nbsp;
authored&nbsp; some books including&nbsp; <strong>&quot;anhikam&quot;</strong> and
&quot;Sarnganeeva Stotram&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord Ranganatha&nbsp;&nbsp;
directed&nbsp;&nbsp; three&nbsp;&nbsp; illustrious &nbsp;&nbsp; persons in their dreams to
go to Sri Gopalarya Mahadesikan and learn the traditional literature and spread the same.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3">Sri Thirukkudanthai Desikan had a dream that he should
teach those three persons - One of the was from Vazhuthur. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He,&nbsp;&nbsp; became&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ascetic &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and&nbsp;&nbsp; came&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; be&nbsp;&nbsp; known &nbsp; as Sri Vedanta
Ramanuja Mahadesikan alias Vazhuthur Andavan. The title &quot;Andavan&quot; was given to
him by Lord Ranganatha as He was protecting &nbsp; the&nbsp; sampradaya.&nbsp;
Sri&nbsp;&nbsp; Vazhuthur&nbsp;&nbsp; Andavan founded the institution in 1776 AD
as&nbsp;&nbsp; per&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; directions &nbsp; of Sri Thirukkudanthai Desikan
at Srirangam which is known as &quot;Periyashramam&quot; on the banks of river Kollidam.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3">When He was&nbsp; in&nbsp; Vazhuthur, for &nbsp;
more&nbsp; than&nbsp; 30&nbsp; years,&nbsp; He did&nbsp; Mangalasasanam&nbsp; for &nbsp;
the Temple of Sri Jagathrakshaka Perumal. It is very well known to many when the curtain
was drawn in the temple, Vazhuthur Swami used to have direct dialog with the
Perumal.&nbsp; When He shifted to Srirangam, He used to do&nbsp; Samaashranam&nbsp; and
&nbsp; Bharanyaasam&nbsp; at&nbsp; Thayaar Sannadhi in the Temple. He is devoted to &nbsp;
Srirangam&nbsp; Perumal so much, that one day, Sri Ranganathar appeared to Him in front of
the Dwajasthambam&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Temple&nbsp; and called, &quot;Protector of our
Sampradayam, <em>Andavanae!</em>&quot; and embraced Him with these words. From that day,
Srimath Andavan name is attached to Periashramam at Srirangam.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="5">3.&nbsp; </font></strong><font
size="5" color="#000000">H.H. Thiruthuraipoondi Andavan (Sri Srinivasa Ramanuja
Mahadesikan)</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3">He succeeded Sri Vazhuthur Andavan, for the Acharya
Peetam, and he stayed in Srirangam and did scriptures etc., When a Young boy from
Kancheepuram requested him to give Sanyasam, he advised him to go back to his parents, get
married and come after the birth of a child. As advised, the Young boy came back to him,
after sometime, and informed His Holiness, that he is now ready to take Sanyasam as he has
married, and is now a father of a male child. H.H. Thiruthuraipoondy Andavan, made him a
Sanyasi and this young man was none other than Srinivasa Mahadesikan, who later became the
famous Srimath Periandavan.</font></p>

<p><font size="5" color="#000000">4. H.H. SRIMATH PERIANDAVAN, SRI SRINIVASA MAHADESIKAN</font><font
COLOR="#0000ff"></p>

<p align="center"></font><font color="#000000" size="3">(1830 -1886 A.D.)</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3">Srimath Periandavan was an ascetic for more than 50
years. For quite a long time, he was in continuous meditation in Srirangam. He used to get
grains from the houses of a few devotees of Lord Ranganatha, by Unchavrithi, only for 7 or
8 days a month, wash the same in Kaveri water, cook the same, and eat it alongwith Thulasi
leaves without salt, ghee, milk or curd. On other days, he used to powder the dry leaves
fallen from the Holy Fig tree, consume the same and drink water. Such was his Vairaagyam.</font><font
COLOR="#0000ff"></p>

<p></font><font color="#000000" size="3">By such severe penance, he became lean, and
emaciated and came to be known as &quot;Vathal Swami&quot;. As he was for long indulging
in Meditation, Lord Ranganatha issued a command to him, to take disciples, and disseminate
and propagate the Religion and Philosophy. Thereafter, several persons became His
Disciples, and turned out to be great men of Learning and preceptors. Some of them who
were famous were</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3">1) Thirupputkuzhi Appa&nbsp; 2) Mannargudi Gopalanna
&nbsp; 3) Vyakaranam Rangachariar&nbsp; 4) Meemisal </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3">Narasimhachariar&nbsp; 5) Chinnamu Rangachariar&nbsp; 6)
Thirunelveli Gopalasamudram Narayanachariar</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3">7) Shamala Chakravarthi and 8) Purisai Nadathur
Rangachariar.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3">One of His disciples purchased a land on the Southern
bank of Coleroon river and offerred it to H.H. Periandavan. His Holiness accepted it and
had a hermitage constructed, where he stayed and rendered Kalakshepams. Sri Periandavan
was a strict disciplinarian and insisted on adherence to absolute discipline among his
disciples, both during the time of Kalakshepams and at other times. It used to be said, in
the morning, when he took the texts in Cadjan Leaves for Kalakshepam, whatever may be the
number of pages, whatever may be the time span, He would not rise from His seat, without
finishing all the pages. He travelled widely in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, by foot, and
performed Samasrayanam and Baranyasam to devotees. He used to render Kalakshepam of
Grantha-Chatushtayam, that is Sri Bashyam, Geetha Bashyam, Srimath Rahasyathrayasaaram and
Sri Bhagavath Vishayam in a year and in that way he had completed them THIRTY times. Such
an illustrious Acharya was succeeded by one of His Disciples, who was tested in several
ways by His Holiness, before he was given Sanyasam. As He became an ascetic, even during
the life of Sri Periandavan, and both Swamis were together for about Six months, He came
to be known as Chinnandavan. His official name was Sri Paduka Sevaka Ramanuja Mahadesikan.</font></p>

(1886 -1895 A.D.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3">He was a great scholar in Dharmasastras
such as Manusmrithi, Yagnavalkya Smrithi, etc., He was often consulted by the British
Government in matters of Hindu Law etc., He authored as many as nine books&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3">1) Ahnikartha prakasika</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3">He had several disciples two of whom became heads of the
Ashramam later, namely Therazhundur Andavan and Thenbarai Andavan. When He left this
mortal world ,at that time, there was none to take charge of the Ashramam for 10 years.
Then some disciples persuaded Sri Varada Vedantachariar to adorn the Acharyapeetam. He
became Sri Srinivasa Ramanuja Mahadesikan alias Kadanthethi Andavan.</font></p>

<p><font size="5" color="#000000">6.&nbsp; Sri Srinivasaramanuja Mahadesikan alias
Kadanthethi Andavan.</font><font COLOR="#0000ff"></p>

<p align="center"></font><font color="#000000" size="3">(1905 -1910 A.D.)</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3">He had mastered several Manthras with the aid of which
He used to perform some miracles. In His poorvashramam when He went by Palanquin, the
front sides were carried by men and the rear side were carried by Mantras without any man.
He pleased the authorities of Thiruppathi Devasthanam with His miracles and the
Devasthanam presented an ivory Palanquin which He presented to Sri Desikan Sannidhi in
Thiruchanur. He authored some stotras. He was a Satavadani. He gifted the benefits
acquired by Him by reciting Thiru Ashtaksharam seven crore times to Eyunni Varadachariar
Swami and also made him a Sanyasi. That was Sri Vedanta Ramanuja Mahadesikan.</font></p>

<p><font size="5" color="#000000">7. Sri Vedanta Ramanuja Mahadesikan alias Therazhundur
Andavan or Nammandavan.</font><font COLOR="#0000ff"></p>

<p align="center"></font><font color="#000000" size="3">(1910 -1931 A.D.)</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3">He had Panchasamskaram under H.H. Sri Periandavan. His
versatility even in his childhood was unrivalled. His erudition and scholarship had no
bounds. He earned several honours in Seminars of Vidwans. He was rewarded by the Maharaja
of Pudukkottai. He had Baranyasam under H.H. Sri Chinnandavan. When the later was thinking
of nominating a successor, Sri Varadhachariar offerred to become a Sanyasi but other
people prevented him as he had elderly parents and young wife. After getting progeny, he
obtained Sanyasam from H.H. Sri Kadanthethi Andavan. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3">During His period, the number of disciples increased.
Everyone was attracted by His sweet qualities. He was an expert in music. He wrote a
commentary in Tamil on Sri Paduka Sahasram for 860 slokas but was prevented by illness
from completing it. He caused the publication of several books through Sri V.K.
Ramanujachariar Swami. He made valuable contributions to several temples and arranged for
continuous performance of festivals an other rituals in some temples. He travelled widely.
He was a rare personality respected even by atheists. His disciple and successor was H.H.
Sri Srinivasa Maha Desikan alias Akkur Andavan or Engal Andavan.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" color="#000000">Sri Akkur Andavan was a disciple of H.H. Nammandavan.
Having studied the scriptures under Him, Sri Akkur Andavan proved to be an expert in
rendering discourses on Srimad Bhagavatham, Srimad Ramayanam etc., He completed the Tamil
Commentary of Sri Paduka Sahasra and published it. He travelled all over South India and
caused renovation and repairs to several temples. He gave sanyasam to Thenbarai Ramabadra
Chariar who was a disciple of H.H.Chinnandavan.</font><font COLOR="#007f7f" size="4"></p>

<p></font><font size="5" color="#000000">9. H.H. Sri Ranganatha Mahadesikan @ Thenbarai

<p align="center"></font><font size="3" color="#000000">(1947 -1963 A.D.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3" color="#000000">His Holiness was an embodiment of Vairagyam (detachment)
and Shantham (quietism). His calm and unperturbed temperament overpowered anyone who
approached him with a disturbed mind. He performed fifteen Chaturmasyams . On account of
indifferent health, He did not move out of the Ashramam. He caused the performance of
Ashtakshara Mahayagyam in the Periashramam premises at Srirangam. He chose such a
successor who could take the institution to dizzy heights and that was Thirukkudanthai
Andavan.</font><font COLOR="#007f7f" size="4"></p>

<p></font><font color="#000000"><font size="5">10. </font><font SIZE="2"><font

<p align="center"></font><font size="3" color="#000000">(1963 -1989 A.D.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3" color="#000000">Named as Srinivasaraghavan by his parents he earned a
popular name &quot;Kannan Swami&quot;. By his discourses in a mellifluous voice he was
very well known throughout the country. It is no wonder that on his entering the fourth
Ashrmam, the institution Srirangam Srimad Andavan Ashramam got expanded beyond
recognition. His Holiness travelled on foot the length and breadth of the country and
attracted thousands of disciples.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" color="#000000">Being a scholar in Nyaya and Vyakarana, He specialised
in Alwars' songs compendiously known as Nalayira Divya Prabandham. The mastery which he
had over the subjects on which he rendered discourses namely, Srimad Ramayanam, Srimad
Bhagavatham, Mahabharatham etc., was simply amazing. The way in which He used to quote
from Divyaprabhandhams used to remind the listener the grandeur of the flow of a perennial
holy river. Whether it was a Kalashepam or upanyasam, he used to intersperse them with
witticism and simple similies which made even an uneducated listener understand easily the
mose abstract philosophical tenets. He carried out repairs and renovations in several
temples and donated several articles and jewellery to various temples.</font><font
SIZE="2" COLOR="#0000ff"></p>

<p></font><u><em><font size="3" color="#000000">He established an Ashramam Branch at
Keezhnattham Village in Tirunelveli District&nbsp; and also Sri Vedanta Desikan Sannathi
at Thirukkurungudi village </font></em></u><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#0000ff"></p>

<p></font><font size="3" color="#000000">He had constructed two temples in Bangalore,at
Jayanagar &amp;Sripuram and&nbsp; one in Delhi. He established branches of the Ashramam in
Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh States besides several
important towns in Tamil Nadu including the city of Madras (Chennai). He performed 26
Chathurmasyams.</font> </p>

<p><font size="3" color="#000000">He rejuvenated the monthly journal &quot;Sri Ranganatha
Paduka&quot;. He created several charitable and educational trusts such as Sri Paduka
Charities in Madras and Sri Ranganatha Paduka Vidyalaya Trust in Srirangam. The latter
trust established an educational institution and started courses in Vedas, Divya
Prabandanis, Sastras, Kavyas etc.,</font></p>

<p><font size="3" color="#000000">When he realised that the Lord wanted him back in His
abode, he gave sanyasam to Mysore Gopalachariar Swami who was a Srikaryam in the Ashramam
and a year later left this mortal world.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="5">11. H.H. Sri Srinivasa Ramanuja Mahadesikan @ Mysore
Andavan</font></b></p>

<p><font size="3" color="#000000">He was a great scholar in Sanskrit. Unfortunately, the
Lord took him away within a month after the departure of Thirukkudanthai Andavan.He was
earlier Srikaryam in the Ashramam at the time of Sri Thirukkudanthai Andavan Swamigal.</font><b><font
COLOR="#007f7f" size="4"></p>

<p></font><font color="#000000" size="5">12. H.H. Sri Rangaramanuja Mahadesikan @
SriMushnam Andavan (Prakirtham Andavan)</font></p>
</b>

<p><font size="3" color="#000000">Fortunately for the Ashramam, H.H. Sri Thirukkudanthai
Andavan had mentioned the name of Srimushnam Sri Varadhachariar Swami as a successor,
probably knowing in advance that H.H. Mysore Andavan may not live for long. When the
Disciples of the Ashramam approached Swami, He had no hesitation in accepting the call to
reiligious order though he had a large family to support.</font> </p>

<p><font size="3" color="#000000">Following the footsteps of the great saint Emberumanar,
he placed <b>&quot;service to society&quot; </b>above his personal family. He took
Kashayam (saffron robe) from <b>Periyandavan sannidhi. </b>Being a scholar of unfathomable
depth in any subject under the sky, His Holiness lost no time in convincing the disciples
of the Ashramam that he can not only carry aloft the banner of the Ashramam but also take
it to further heights.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" color="#000000">His expertise in Sastras, Vedas, Music, Dance, Medicine,
Sculpture, literature (both Tamil and Sanskrit) and Paka Sastra baffles everyone. He has
constructed a <b>Temple in Sripuram, Bangalore. </b>He has founded a college in <b>Arts
and Science at Srirangam </b>under the auspices of <b>Sri Ranganatha Paduka Vidyalaya
Trust. </b></font><font COLOR="#0000ff"></p>

<p></font><font size="3" color="#000000">He is not only continuing what had commenced
during the time of Poorvacharyas but also adding to the same and expanding the activities
which are useful to the society. His witticism in conversations is remarkable.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The&nbsp;&nbsp; disciples&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the &nbsp;&nbsp; Ashramam&nbsp;&nbsp;
are&nbsp;&nbsp; greatful&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; the &nbsp; Lord&nbsp;&nbsp;
for&nbsp;&nbsp; installing H.H. SriRangaramanuja Mahadesikan as the head of the
Institution. We pray to the Lord and the Poorvacharyas to bless H.H. with Long life and
sturdy health.</font><font size="4"><b></p>

<p><font color="#000000">CONCLUSION:</font></b><font COLOR="#0000ff"></p>

<p></font></font><font size="3" color="#000000">Before concluding, it is necessary to
mention that Srimad Andavan Ashramam maintains the unique practice of worshipping the
Padukas of Poorva Acharyas. Several of the disciples of the Ashram perform not only
Bhagawad Aradhanam but also Paduka Aradhanam. The Acharyas of the Ashramam are so keen
that the disciples should get the blessings of the Lord, they perform Samasrayanam and
Bharanyasam on being requested without any delay. Our Acharyas have performed Bharanyasam
even for new-born babies, animals and birds. We, the disciples of the Ashramam would
always follow the ancient path shown to us by our Acharyas, which is safe and good. So, we
adore the regular and spotless succession of Acharyas which is well known to extend
upwards to the Lord.</font></p>
