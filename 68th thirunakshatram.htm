<font face="Arial" size="2">The Srikaryam Swami has already filed his report on 
these in the Aani &amp; Aadi issues of Paduka:</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">i) There were large gatherings of sevarthis to have 
a darshan of H.H. right from 12th May onwards when He arrived in Chennai after 
completing His Mangalasasanams of Alarmelmangai Thayar, Sri Govindaraja Perumal 
&amp; His Consort and finally Sri Balaji at Thiruchanur, Thirupathi and Thirumala 
respectively on the 9th and 11th May 2002. A very large contingent of Sishyas 
and Abhimanis had the Bhagyam of having the Darshan of the Divya Dhampathis 
along with H.H. during these days. In particular the sevarthis had the unique 
privilege of the seva of Friday Thirumanjanam performed for Alarmelmangai Thayar 
in the presence of H.H on Friday the 10th May 2002.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">ii) Hundreds of sevarthis, many of them new faces 
particularly the young ones, thronged the Asramam daily during the 4 - 5 weeks 
that H.H. camped at the Chennai Asramam. On Sundays the 19th, 26th May and 2nd 
June we had literally hundreds of sevarthis, these were just Sundays, not 
Thirunakshatram days, nothing special, but still the crowds were so large giving 
us great hope for the future continuity. Many were new faces – new period – 
never seen before in a gathering at our Asramam or any Mutt during the past 30 
years that the writer has been visiting such institutions. The most encouraging 
fact was that we found so many new and young faces – in the 25 to 35 age group; 
obviously the reputation of H.H., His Sowlabyam &amp; Sowseelyam has spread far and 
wide attracting these youngsters to come in to find out more about H.H. and the 
Asramam. Then they keep coming and coming, as there is no demand from anyone 
unless the sevarthis offer to give something on their own!&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">iii) The Thirunakshatram celebrations commenced on 
the 8th June. After H.H. performed the Perumal and Paduka Aradhanams, the Veda 
and Grantha Parayanams were taken up, nearly 200 Rikwiks were present on the 
opening session; this grew in numbers till it reached almost 270 by the 12th 
June. According to H.H. this entire hullabaloo was uncalled for; we disagreed 
with Him totally on this, as it is our rare privilege to celebrate this joyous 
occasion though H.H. rightly maintains that this is not some milestone like the 
61st or the 71st or the 81st Thirunakshatram. The point is that so many Rikwiks 
turned up without much of a mobilization, which will be there for those 
milestones for we have to plan from now on. It was indeed a very pleasant sight 
to see this eminent group of Vedic Scholars being organized and handled with 
utmost courtesy by the Srikaryam Swami with the spontaneous and voluntary 
assistance of Sarvashrimans V.K.Sarangarajan, R.Vasudevan, S.Rangarajan and 
(last but not the least) R.Srinivasan and A.Venkatavaradhan. The Vidwath 
Sambavanai was settled at the end of each session to ensure equity and to avoid 
dissatisfaction amongst the participants. ‘Latecomers’ and ‘part timers’ 
demanding ‘full’ Sambavanai were handled with commendable tact and firmness. One 
unruly Senior Rikwik was advised firmly by the Chairman that he was most 
unwelcome for future Thirunakshatrams and shown the door. It was an unpleasant 
thing to do, he had to do it, he did it (this did create some small ripples) but 
the Honourable members have a right to know what happened. </font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">iv) Accepting our humble prayers, H.H. Sri Abhinava 
Vageesa Swami, the 36th Jeer of Sri Brahmatantra Swatantra Sri Parakalaswami 
Mutt of Mysore, came over to Chennai to participate in the celebrations on the 
evening of the 10 th June. The Srikaryam Swami and the Chairman received Him 
with reverential honours (&amp; with Poornakumbams) at the main road junction and at 
the entrance of the Asramam. A very large gathering was privileged to have the 
Darshan of the two Yatheeswarars and they were blessed to have a repeat of these 
blessings through till the 15th June. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">v) It was a heavenly sight to see hundreds and 
thousands of sevarthis attending the Sevakalam of the Lakshmi Hayagriva 
Aradhanams performed by H.H. Sri Parakala Swami &amp; the Perumal – Paduka 
Aradhanams performed by H.H. Srimad Andavan <u>from the same premises at the 
same time.</u> Even more thrilling were the sights of H.H Sri Parakala Swami 
being served with the Theertha Prasadams by our H.H. (and Sri Satari by our 
Aradhakar) &amp; our H.H. receiving these Prasadams from H.H. Sri Parakala Swami (&amp; 
their Aradhakar) <u>and thereafter both the Yatheeswarars serving the Theertha 
Prasadams simultaneously to the huge Goshtis everyday till the 15th June</u>.
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;In my long years I have never witnessed such a 
glorious sight at any Asramam or Mutt (though we have seen the Senior and the 
Junior Yathis of the same Institution performing the Aradhanams together). We 
can attribute this great Bhagyam to the Punyams of our ancestors and feel a 
sense of great pride that we are indeed fortunate to be living in the Era of 
these noble Yathis &amp; great souls!&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">vi) There were music performances every evening from 
the 8th to the 12th June by eminent artists, on the 9th evening H.H. honoured 
the great flute maestro Shri N.Ramani with the title ‘Venugana Kaladhara’ to 
commemorate the artist’s 60 years of service to Carnatic music. A citation and a 
cash award were given to the maestro on the occasion and he reciprocated this by 
stating that though he had received many awards in the past, he will value this 
award the most as it has come from an eminent Yathi who was himself a great 
connoisseur and exponent of Carnatic music.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">vii) The large gatherings of sevarthis during the 
run up to the D–Day should have served a warning to the Trustees and other 
committee members. Nothing prepared them for the huge multitude of Sishyas and 
Abhimanis who thronged the Asramam on the 12th June from 6.30 a.m onwards. By 
the time the sevakalam was nearing completion there were thousands of sevarthis 
milling around the two buildings and overflowing into the main roads. Outsiders 
with no sentimental baggage estimate the gathering at over 5,000 in the morning 
session itself and the total number through the day at over 7,000. Fortunately 
this was a working day week! Special mention must be made of Shrimans 
V.S.Narasimhan, V.Srinivasan,&nbsp;&nbsp; K.Ravi,&nbsp;&nbsp; S.Parthasarathi,&nbsp; N.Kasturi Rangan,&nbsp; 
V.Sridhar A.Venkatavaradhan, V.Chakravarthi and many many others who regulated 
the milling crowds of sevarthis with utmost courtesy (and compassion 
particularly towards the elderly persons) throughout the day and made sure that 
the whole affair was handled in a neat and orderly manner.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">viii) The Theertha Prasadams, Sri Satari of both 
Parakala Mutt and Andavan Asramam took nearly till 10.00 am to be served in 
spite of the fact that many senior Rikwiks, competent and authorized to do so, 
served the Theertha Prasadams, then a novel method of blessing the sevarthis was 
adopted, the usual method was that the sevarthis used to queue up and receive 
the Blessings of H.H. but this time the huge gathering meant that this itself 
would have taken another 3-4 hours, so H.H. advised everyone to stay put in 
their respective places. He went all round the two buildings, all the sevarthis 
were calmly seated, H.H. blessed everyone by sprinkling the Mantrakshadai on all 
of them without leaving out anyone &amp; the whole affair was over in 30 minutes.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">ix) The Peria Sathumarai was taken up around 10.45 
a.m, this went on till 11.30 a.m. and the Theertha Prasadams to the Goshtis were 
duly completed. Thereafter both the Yatheeswarars were brought to the dais, the 
Malai Mariyadai from around 90 Divya Desams and other Abhimana Kshetrams were 
offered to their Holinesses. H.H. thereafter honoured this year’s President’s 
Awardees in Sanskrit, our own Asthana Ganapati Sri Veeravalli Srinivasa 
Desikachariar and Maha Vidwan Sri U.Ve. SriVatsankachariar with a shawl and cash 
award each.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">x) H.H. then released five Granthams and books, 
namely ‘Chatus Sloki’ – (Bhashyam &amp; Vyakyanam by H.H. himself), ‘Sri Bashyam – 
an English treatise’ – a reprint of the late Shri V.K.Ramanujachariar’s works, 
‘Archaka Thunaivan’ a treatise on Agamas by our Patasala Professor Sri 
Koothapakkam Raghavachar Swami (Kannamachar Swami - a contemporary of our 
Srikaryam Swami) &amp; “Stotravali” a compilation of the Sri Sookthis - 63 hymns 
composed by (Wait – this is an interesting revelation!) H.H. Srimad Andavan 
Himself in His Poorvasrama. A young Computer Science Engineer, Sri C.G. Balaji 
(grandson of one of the great scholars of our times, Sri N.S. Anantha Rangachar 
Swami), has done this compilation. H.H. also honoured i) Sri S.N.Srirama 
Desikachar (a former President’s Awardee in Sanskrit) for his book on ‘Susrutha 
Samhitha” a treatise on Ayurvedic Surgery sponsored by H.H. Srimad Andavan <u>
and released during this Thirunakshatram day</u> &amp; ii) Sri N.Krishnan, an 
eminent Music Scholar and the disciple of the late Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar 
with the title ‘Gayaka Kalanidhi’ and a cash award. This award to eminent 
musicologists has now become an annual feature of H.H.’s Thirunakshatram.</font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">xi) Then, wonder of wonders, 10 great Sanskrit 
Scholars – all of them having known H.H. for quite sometime – spoke eloquently 
for just 2-3 minutes each (brevity at the request of H.H!!) and the Vidvan’s 
Upanyasams were also over in less than 30 minutes!! H.H. Sri Parakala Swami and 
H.H. Srimad Andavan thereafter delivered scintillating Anugraha Bashanams in 
their inimitable style listened to with rapt attention by the huge audience. The 
last item on the program was of course the delicious Thadeearadhanam – both 
quality and delivery.&nbsp; It must be admitted that the Asramam Kainkaryaparas 
excelled themselves on this occasion, they flatly refused our offer of engaging 
outside cooks for this purpose, no doubt they do create an occasional wrong 
impression with their ‘noise and voice levels’ but when it comes down to the 
cinch they deliver and how well they have done so this time around is a matter 
that the Chairman wishes to place on record.&nbsp; We have also received reports from 
all other centers in India and from 16 centers in U.S.A about the celebrations 
and feel so humble and privileged to be a part of all this. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">xii) On the 13th June, H.H. addressed the students 
of Ahobila Mutt Oriental School along with H.H. the Jeer of Sri Parakala Mutt 
and thereafter performed the Mangalasasanam at Sri Sathyanarayana Perumal Temple 
in West Mambalam. H.H. camped at Chennai till Saturday the 15th June and left 
for Thiruvahindrapuram. H.H. Sri Parakala Swami continued to stay at our Asramam 
till the 27th June, performed the Aradhanams for Sri Lakshmi Hayagreeva and the 
other Deities and blessed the sevarthis who came in their hundreds to receive 
His Anugrahams.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">xiii) H.H. performed Mangalasasanam at Sri Devanatha 
Perumal Temple on Sunday the 16th June. There was a huge crowd of sevarthis 
present for the Sevakalam and the Mangalasasanam and the enthusiasm of the 
youngsters was simply infectious. H.H thereafter proceeded to Vaduvur on the 
18th June via Cuddalore, Neyveli (H.H. visited the&nbsp; Thermal Station of the N.L.C.) 
and Mannargudi after performing Mangalasasanam to Sri Rajagopalaswami at 
Mannargudi on the 18th. At Vaduvur He performed Mangalasasanam at Sri 
Kothandaramaswami temple on the 19th, blessed the Vidyarthis at our Veda 
Patasala – student strength now 26 – before proceeding to Kumbakonam on the 
evening of the 19th when He performed His Mangalasasanam at Sri Sarangapani 
Temple with full Temple Honours. At Kumbakonam, H.H. camped for three days to 
inaugurate and grace the annual Tamizh Marai Innisai and Thiruppavai Festivals 
(an important annual event in our Asramam’s calendar) being conducted by our 
Asthana Vidwan Sri Kalyanapuram NathaMuni Aravamudhachariar. As usual many 
eminent Vidwans delivered their scintillating Upanyasams.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">xiv) H.H. performed the Mangalasasanams on the 22nd 
and 24th June respectively at Thiruvelliangudi and Sri Oppiliappankoil and at 
Vazhuthur Perumal temple on the 25th June. The Vazhuthur Asramam is coming along 
nicely due to the committed and sincere Kainkaryam of Sri R.K. Chari and his 
associates. The administration of this Asramam is to be institutionalised now. 
After camping in Vazhuthur for two days H.H. proceeded to Srirangam where He 
rested for 12 days. On the 28th June, the new block at our Srimad Andavan Arts &amp; 
Science College was formally inaugurated in the presence of H.H. Srimad Andavan 
after our Asthana Ganapati Sri Srinivasa Desikachariar and a group of eminent 
Rikwiks performed Vaastu Homam, Sri Purusha Sooktha Homam etc., The Minister for 
Information and Public Relations (of the T.N. Government) Sri K.K. 
Balasubramaniam and some local VIP’s attended this rather private ceremony.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">xv) Thereafter H.H. addressed all the students and 
gave them a soul filling Bashanam listing their ambitions and goals and 
emphasized that they should aim to become model citizens before attempting to be 
brightest and the best students and somehow, what would have been a cliché 
ridden oft repeated concept became a live tool in the words of H.H. – Himself a 
teacher in His Poorvasrama. Nearly 1000 students and members of the faculty 
heard him out in pin drop silence and with rapt attention. Thereafter H.H. in 
repetition of the 12th June system went around the assemblage and blessed them 
with Mantrakshadai.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">xvi) H.H. was in Srirangam Periasramam till the 12th 
July, had some well earned rest after His hectic schedule over the past several 
months and traveled to Thiruppullani for the annual Sethu Snanam. He was 
accompanied by a large contingent of sevarthis as usual. H.H performed 
Mangalasasanams of Sri Jagannatha Perumal at Thiruppullani and later on at the 
AdhiNathar Temple at Azhwar Thirunagari. We have an Asramam at Thiruppullani and 
are renovating the Desikan Sannathi therein. In Azhwar Thirunagari we are 
setting up an Asramam with a Veda Patasala – this one is for Rig Veda, a private 
Patasala is being taken over, the Kartha is inclined to hand over the same to 
H.H. – with the Padukas’ Blessings this will become a reality very soon.</font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2">xvii) H.H. thereafter camped in Madurai for a couple 
of days, performed Mangalasasanam at the Koodalazhagar Temple, thereafter camped 
in Dindigul, Salem, Hosur en route to Bangalore – Sripuram Asramam – where He 
was scheduled to observe His 14th Chatur Maasya Sankalpam from the 24th July 
till the 21st September 2002. H.H. eventually reached Bangalore on the evening 
of Sunday the 21st July and was accorded a warm and reverential welcome by a 
large gathering – this has become such a routine affair now that in future we 
are not going to mention this again!!</font></p>
