<p><em>SrimAn vEnkata nAthAryaha kavitharkika kEsari |</em></p>
<p><em>VEdanthacharya varyOme sannidhaththAm sadA hrudhi ||</em></p>
<p>Swami Desikan was born in the month of Purattasi, in the vibhava year
according to Tamil Almanac in the nakshathra was Shravanam, the sacred
nakshatram of ThiruvenkatamudayAn. The infant was given the name Venkatanathan
by his parents, Anathasuri and Thotharamba. Samskaras or ceremonies like
Jatakarma, Namakarana, anna prAsana and shauLa were all conducted to the boy, by
their parents at appropriate years. Venkatanatha grew up in the atmosphere of
devotion to Bhagavan and his bhakthas.</p>
<p>It was a memorable day in the life of Venkatanatha at the age of five. His
uncle Appullar took him to the temple of Varadaraja where his Acharya Nadadur
Ammal was expounding Sri Bhashya to his disciples. The disciples, who were so
much absorbed in the appearance of the boy, forgot the trend of the lesson. When
asked by NadAdur Ammal to his disciples where he left the kAlakshebham, the
young boy, with the permission of the teacher Kidambi AppuLLAr lisped out the
words to the surprise of all. Nadadur Ammal was so much pleased by the boy’s
intelligence that he blessed him with long life, great knowledge, and worldwide
reputation.</p>
<p>At the age of 7, Upanayanam was conducted for venkatanathan. From that time
Appullar took charge of the education of the boy Venkatanathan. Venkatanathan
was initiated with Sri Vainateya manthra by his uncle, who began teaching
sasthras and the vedas. He also studied Tarka and Mimamsa and acquired mastery
over other systems of philosophies. Due to the constant meditation on Lord
Hayagreeva, Lord Hayagreeva was pleased and bestowed Venkatanathan the great
virtue of nectar of knowledge..</p>
<p>When he was residing at Kanchi, His unique gifts of poetics and dialectics
earned him the name of Kavitharkika simham. His sovereignty in the field
Vedantha earned him the title of Vedanthacharya. His sishyas called him Swami
Desikan. He channeled all his varied powers, to establish Sri Ramanujas systems
on firm and secure foundations, rendering it ever impregnable to adverse
attacks.</p>

Tamil. Sthothra granthas (28), Kavya granthas (4), Natakam(1), Vedhantha
