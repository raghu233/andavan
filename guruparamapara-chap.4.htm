    <p><font face="comic sans ms" size="2">Sri Gopala Desikan was born in
    Aathreya gothram in Sri Appullar's Vamsam (Swami Desikan's maternal uncle).
    The kootasthar of this Vamsam Sri Kidambi Aachaan (also known as madaippalli
    Aachaan) was doing the Madaippalli kainkaryam to Sri Ramanuja.
    Thirukkudanthai Gopala Desikan was the direct and fifteenth descendant of
    Appullar. Swami's Avatharam took place in Vikrama Varusham (1700) purattasi
    madham, pooradam star, sukla paksham, navami thithi in dhanur lagnam. Swami
    received his pancha samaskaram and veda adhyanam from his father Sri Krishna
    Suri. From his father, he also learnt tharkam, vyakaranam, meemamsam, Divya
    Prabhandham, Desika Prabhandham &amp; Sthothra paatams of Sri NigamAntha
    MahA dEsikan and became an erudite scholar.</font></p>
    <p><font face="comic sans ms"><font size="2">Sri Gopala Desikan requested
    Saakshaath swami to bless him and take him as a sishya. Saakshath swami,
    after testing his gnanam, anushtanam and bhakthi was immensely pleased and
    blessed him and accepted him as his sishya. Sri Gopala Desikan studied
    Srimath Rahasyathraya Saaram, Sri Bhaashyam, Geethaa Bhaashyam, Sri
    Paancharaathra Prabruthi, Anushtaana Granthas, Sruthaprakaasikaa,
    Thaathparya Chandrikaa, Sathadooshani, Thathva mukthaa kalaabaa, Nyasavidyaa
    Darpana and Sri Thathva Sidhanjanam under the holy feet of Saakshaath swami.
    Saakshath swami instructed Sri Gopala Desikan to learn Bhagavath Vishayam
    from his Satheerthar and disciple Sri Paduka Sevaka Ramanuja muni, who had
    learnt 24 Ayirappadi earlier from Sri Saakshath swami. As instructed, Sri
    Gopala dEsikan studied Bhagavath Vishayam from Padhuka Sevaka Ramanuja muni
    and became a scholar in that too, and requested Sri Saakshaath swami for
    Bharasamarpanam. Saakshaath swami was very much pleased at his request and
    perfromed Prapatti for Sri Gopala Desikan at the sacred feet of Lord Sri
    Ranganatha through Acharya nishtai. &nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="comic sans ms" size="2">When he offered prayers with
    AparyabdhAmritha Dhyana slokam to Lord at Thirukkudanthai. Lord Aravamudhan
    appeared through archakar and granted the name <b>Thirukkudanthai Desikan</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="comic sans ms" size="2">Other works of swami are Ahniga
    Grantham, Sri Desika sahasranamam, Nikshepa Chinthamani also known as
    Saranaagathi Saasthra Vivaranam, Sangraha Vyaakyaanams for Kanninun
    Siruththambu, Thiruppallandu, Sri Jayanthi Nirnayam, Aparyabdhamritha Dhyana
    sopanam on Araavamudhan (similar to Bhagavath Dhyana sopanam of Swami
    Desikan on Lord Ranganatha) One day Lord Aparyabdhamudhan appeared in the
    dream of Thirukudanthai Desikan and told him that three yatheeswas, the Amsa
    avatharams of Sri Nathamuni, Sri Alavanthar, and Sri Bashyakarar will come
    and request him to take them as his sishyas and instructed him to accept
    them as his sishyas and teach them the Munithraya sath-sampradayam, the
    sampradayam passed down by three munis namely Nathamuni, Yamunamuni and
    Ramanuja Muni. Similarly Lord appeared in the dream of the three swamis
    also, and told them to take up Thureeyasramam and become sishyas of
    Thirukkudanthai Desikan swami. The three swamis were:</font></p>

    Vathiraairuppu, Thirumaliruncholai near Madurai Sri Vedantha Ramanuja Maha
    Desikan of Vazhuthur, a small village near Thirukkudanthai. Thirukkudanthai
    Desikan swami took all three of them as his sishyas and taught them all the
    granthas through upadesams and kalakshebams. One day during Adhyayanothsavam
    Sarrumurai time when swami, along with the three sishyas did mangalasaasanam
    at Amudhan sannidhi, Lord Amudhan through Archamukam, awarded the thirunamam
    <b>&quot;MUNITHRAYA SAMPRADHAYA PRAVARTHAKAR&quot; </b>to Srimath
    Thirukkudanthai Desikan. Swami accepted it with humility saying, &quot;Naayindhen,
    DhanyOsmi&quot;. Swami instructed the yatheeswaras to do sampradhaya
    pravachanam from their respective places. The yatheeswaras returned back to
    their villages. Of these yatheeswaras,</font></p>
    <p><font face="comic sans ms" size="2">Srimath Thirukkudanthai Desikan led a
    life of Acharya in gruhasthashrama for almost all of his life like Swami

    Karthigai month on Pushya star-Krishna panchami) with the name
    Aparyabdhaamridha Maha Desikan. The very next day, in Plava varusham

    It is told that Sri Gopalarya Maha Desikan blessed Vazhuthur swamy that
    &quot;<b>Neeray num sampradhaayathai Aala vandha Andavan</b>&quot; meaning
    you alone are going to guard, rule and spread our sampradhaayam&quot;. From

    was called as <b>Srimath Aandavan Asramam Sampradhaayam</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
