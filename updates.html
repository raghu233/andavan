<p>
    The ever abundant Grace &amp; Blessings of Sri Ranganachiar &amp; Sri Ranganatha and the Poorvacharyas have enabled, motivated &amp; empowered HH Srimad
    Andavan to embark on an amazing &amp; unprecedented journey during the past 26 years. Apart from the mandatory duties as the AchAryA of this hoary Peetam,
    countless 1000’s have had their Pancha SamskArams &amp; Prapatti performed by Him since that eventful day of 01-06-1989. Adiyen has had the rare privilege
    to chronicle the Kainkaryams of HH Srimad Andavan; this is being updated &amp; will be circulated to ALL Sevarthis.
</p>
<p>
    We annex hereto a short note &amp; an expenses estimate of the celebrations &amp; attach a CD on the phenomenal progress – Blessed by the Divya Dhampathi
    &amp; The Padukas – of Srimad Andavan Arts &amp; Science College over the 18 years since its inception.
</p>
<p>
    Adiyen earnestly appeals for your munificent contributions which have always flowed in like an endless stream!! <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    With warmest regards &amp; in the Service for The Padukas, adiyen remains,
</p>
<p>
    Yours truly,

    NOTE ON THE SATHABHISHEKAM CELEBRATIONS OF HH SRIMAD SRIMUSHNAM ANDAVAN
</p>
<p>
    VENUE – OUR SRIMAD ANDAVAN ARTS &amp; SCIENCE COLLEGE CAMPUS IN NELSON ROAD, THIRUVANAIKOIL, TIRUCHIRAPPALLI 620005.
</p>
<p>
    PARAYANAMS à The Asramam has been at the vanguard of Vedic &amp; Saastric education for nearly 50 years now; qualified Scholars will be invited for Veda,
    Grantha Parayanam &amp; will be honored with proper Sambavanai &amp; Conveyance.
</p>
<p>
    KAINKARYAPARARS have served the AchAryAs &amp; the Institution; theirs is a labour of love performed without looking at the clock or calendar! Each one of
    them would earn multiples of what earn here if they were to venture outside as there is a severe dearth of qualified Adhikaris in the religious circuit all
    over the country! We will honour these honorable persons appropriately; the least we can do on this occasion!
</p>
<p>
    SRIMAD ANDAVAN ARTS &amp; SCIENCE COLLEGE à The College has been accredited twice with the coveted “A” Grade by the NA&amp;AC since 2007 &amp; has been
    accorded the State of Autonomy by the UGC in 2013-14 valid till AY 2019-20. The Institution is taking the next big step to become a “University”; your
    College is one of the eight (&amp; the only Self Financing College) recommended by the Bharathi Dasan University to the UGC for approval as a “College of
    Potential Excellence”.
</p>
<p>
    Full details are in the CD showing a Power point presentation on the College. HH has invested Rs. 20.00 Crores in the Physical &amp; Rs.20.00 Crores in the
    Human Infrastructure for the College alone till date; we need Rs. 12-14 Crores for its immediate expansion plans. HH had applied (in the past) &amp; will
apply in the future, most of the Sambavanai for the Educational activities carried out on His Orders by Sri Ranganatha Paduka Vidyalaya Trust founded by    <strong><em><u>His AchAryA</u></em></strong>, HH Srimad Thirukkudanthai Andavan.
</p>
<p>
    FUTURE MISSION &amp; PLANS à HH Srimad Andavan has defined long term Mission &amp; Vision in the field of Traditional &amp; Modern Education. A large
    number projects are to be conceived, implemented and administered and would (at current costs) entail an outlay of over Rs. 300 Crores over the next 13-15
    years. As such, we are not specifically nominating any specific project to commemorate the Sathabhishekam of HH.
</p>
