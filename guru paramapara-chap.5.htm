Thirutthuraipoondi Andavan gave sanyasam to Sri<br>
Srinivasaraghavachariar Swami who went on to become one of<br>
illustrious Acharyas of Munitraya Sampradayam, and unparalled among<br>
His contemporaries. This mahan later came to be known as the famous<br>
Srimath Periandavan.<br>
<br>
SrinivasaRaghavan was born on 25.2.1801 in the year Roudri (Masi-<br>
pushyam) in a village called Piliyaranai near Kanchipuram. At a<br>
tender age of 10, he mastered rendering of Sama Veda learnt from his<br>
father, Sri Krishnamachariar which was considered to be an invaluable<br>
wealth in his family traditions.<br>
<br>
Sri Krishnamachariar was extremely pleased with his son's progress<br>
and took the young boy back to Kanchi . There, SrinivasaRaghavan<br>
learnt Nyaya – Meemamsa- Vyakarana Sastras under the tutelage of<br>
great scholars. Thereafter he went to Srirangam to see Srirangam<br>
Swami (Srimath Vazhutoor Andavan) and prayed for Saranagathi.<br>
Srimath Andavan , performed Atma samarpanam ( saranagathi) to him in<br>
front of Lord Sri Ranganatha's sannidhi.<br>
<br>
He went to Srirangam Swami and prayed to him that Swami perform<br>
kalakshepams to him on sampradayic granthams.. Thirutthuraipoondi<br>
Andavan took Agnya from Swami in carrying out this holy task and<br>
performed kalakshepams to Srinivasaraghavan on Grantha<br>
chatushtayam,Rahasyams and Rahasyarthas.<br>
<br>
SrinivasaRaghavan gained exemplary knowledge in all that learnt from<br>
his Acharya. After some time, he prayed to Srimath Thirutthuraipoondi<br>
Andavan for the Dureeyasramam. As his near and dear objected to this,<br>
Srimath Andavan also felt that SrinivasaRaghavan be a gruhasta for<br>
some more time before taking up sanyAs and blessed him to go back to<br>
Kanchi.<br>
<br>
In His gruhastasrama, SrinivasaraghavswAmi was blessed with a girl<br>
and He immediately felt that He had fulfilled his duties as a<br>
gruhasta. When Srinivasaraghavan swami went to Srirangam and prayed<br>
with thirutthuraipoondi Andavan for sanyasa, Swami tested Him in<br>
various ways to see whether He was ready to take up sanyasa .<br>
After getting convinced, Swami granted sanyasam to Srimath<br>
Periandavan and he was given the title &quot;Srinivasa maha desikan&quot;.<br>
Since this mahan was so popular among his sishyas and admirers alike,<br>
he was fondly called as periandavan. For a long time he was residing<br>
in Srirangam . In a month, He would go to devout and pious<br>
Srivaishnava bhagavathas' thiru maligai on selected seven to eight<br>
days for unccha Vritthi . He would take the grains to the banks of<br>
Coleroon river, wash them in the river water, cook them and eat the<br>
bhagavath prasadham along with thulasi leaves. On other days, he used<br>
to powder the dry leaves fallen from the Holy Fig tree and consume<br>
the same. Such was his Vairaghyam.<br>
<br>
Sishya paramapara:- He remained deeply dedicated to the sampradayam<br>
and placed Srimad Andavan sampradayam on a firm footing and as a<br>
beacon light to thirsty aspirants. Upon Lord Ranganatha's command to<br>
take disciples, and disseminate and propagate the Philosophy, several<br>
persons became His Disciples, and became erudite scholars and<br>
preceptors. Some of them were<br>
<br>
<br>
1) Thirupputkuzhi Appa 2) Mannargudi Gopalanna 3) Vyakaranam<br>
Rangachariar 4) Meemisal Narasimhachariar 5) Chinnamu Rangachariar 6)<br>
Thirunelveli Gopalasamudram Narayanachariar 7) Shamala Chakravarthi<br>
and 8) Purisai Nadathur Rangachariar.<br>
<br>
Sri Srinivasa Raghavachariar's (Periandavan's) asrama sweekaram took<br>
place around 1828. He observed Chathurmasyams for 55 years and he<br>
adorned thirunadu in subhanu varusham thai masam - krishna<br>
thrayodhasi thithi(1884-Jan-Feb)<br>
