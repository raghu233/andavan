<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Report
on Chaturmasya Sankalpam of Srimath Andavan Swamigal</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">A&nbsp; Brief
report on Chaturmasya Sankalpam&nbsp; celebrations at Alwarthirunagari of Srimath Andavan
Swamigal. 18th July 2003 was a great day in the history of Srirangam Srimath Andavan
Ashramam at Alwarthirunagari, the sacred place of Sri Nammalwar, our Ashramam has its own
residential property.&nbsp; A couple of old houses on the outer street of Sri Aadhinaathar
Temple were bought and with the support of TVS family, a fully renovated building has been
consecrated by&nbsp; His Holiness to accommodate both Srimath Andavan Ashramam and Sri
Ranganatha Paduka Vidyalaya. Devotees from all over India, including a large contingent
from Mumbai, started arriving one day before itself to witness the commencement of
Chatumasya Sankalpam of His Holiness on 18th July.&nbsp; The renovated buildings with all
the facilities have come out very nicely, thanks to the coordination efforts done by our
NEC Chairman Sri R Rajagopal and the efforts of a dedicated team workers deputed by
T.V.S., who worked day and night for the last 2 months to complete the facility to be
ready for occupation well before the commencement of Sankalpam. Opposite to our Ashramam
is the famous&nbsp; Sri Aadhinaathar Temple, within which lies the famous
&quot;Urangaapuli&quot; tamarind tree, which was the abode of Sri Nammalwar and from where
the famous Thiruvoimozhi paasurams originated.&nbsp; This tree continues to exist even
today from the time Nammalvar around 5000 years ago.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Behind our
Ashramam is Tambirabarani River, which is the lifeline of the entire Tirunelveli District.
In these pleasant surroundings our Ashramam started functioning at Alwarthirunagari, which
is central to the famous Nava Thirupathi Divyadesams.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">From the early
morning itself on the 18th July, hundreds of devotees started assembling at
Ashramam.&nbsp; Sri Karyam Swamy, Sri Narasimharaghavachariar,&nbsp; Sri R.Rajagopal,.Sri
Vaduvoor Srinivasa Desikachariar, Sri Kalyanapuram Aravamudachariar, Sri Villoor

event.From Sri Paduka Charities,Sri S.Vasudevan, Secretary, Sri Sarangarajan,Sri
Kasturirangan, Sri Krishnan,Sri Parthasarathi,R.Srinivasan and Sri V.Srinivasan were in
attenadance. (Sri Narayanan of Srimath Andavan Trust, a native of adjacent
Keezhnaththam,was also present.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">After the usual
mornings anushtanam,&nbsp; Srimath Andavan performed Perumal and Paduka Aaradanams.
&nbsp;Sri Venugopalan araadanam was performed by aaraadakar Sri Calcutta Krishnamurthy
swamy.&nbsp; After this it was theertha ghoshti for the devotees.</span></p>

swamy did the sankalpam ceremony for HH.&nbsp; All the devotees attentively participated
in this even and considered the same as a great blessings in their lifetime.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">On completion of
this, H.H, went for &quot;Thirumudivilakkam&quot; on the banks of river
Tambirabarani.&nbsp; After taking bath at the river and&nbsp; &quot;Thirumankappu&quot;
.&nbsp; H.H. returned back to Ashramam in a procession and at the entrance H.H., was
received with Mangala Aarathi by the ladies present there.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">During this
period, several vidwans present in the Hall, gave discourses for the devotees.&nbsp;
Several other devotees went to the nearby Divyadesa Temple of Sri Adinathar and the
sannathi of Sri Nammalwar.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">All these events
were followed by Pancha Santhi by vedic scholars and Divyadesa mariyaadais for H.H., Among
them were Srivilliputhur, Kancheepuram, Thirukkudanthai, Uppiliappan Koil,
Thiruvananthapuram, all the nine divyadesams of Nava Thiruppathi, Vanamaamalai dand
Thirukkurungudi etc.,&nbsp; Srikaryam Sri Narasimha Raghavachariar Swamy presented all
these temple honours to H.H</span></p>

delivered His anugrahabashanam. At the end of these,&nbsp; a grand Thadeeyaaraadanam was
arranged for all the vedic scholars and devotees. On conclusion of all these events, H.H.,

the first day of Chaturmasya Sankalpam. The devotees who attended this function, had a
great opportunity to visit all the 9 divyadesams of Nava Thirupathi and the adjacent
Vaanamaamalai and Thirukkurungudi.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The devotees had
the opportunity of visiting Nava Thirupathi.&nbsp; The credit of renovation and excellent
maintenance of all of them goes to the big three letter word T.V.S., and particularly
under the giant Industrialist and grand son of TVS, Sri Venu Srinivasan.&nbsp; Every one
in those villages speaks very high of TVS.&nbsp; It is a great sight to see the new
vibrant Nava Thirupathees now.&nbsp; Every where spic and span, discipline and right as
per time schedule. Those who have not visited these kshetras and may now take this great
opportunity provided by H.H., who is now camping there for two months.&nbsp; You can get
blessings of Srimath Andavan Swamigal, as well as visit the Divyadesams.&nbsp; No worry
about food, there is Andavan Ashramam for you there.&nbsp; Nearer to this there are 2
other divyadesams of Thirukkurungudi and Vaanamaamalai.&nbsp; At Thirukkurungudi apart
from the well known five Nambi temples, please do visit Parivattapparai of Sri Ramanuja
and Brindavanam of Sri Thirumangai Azhwar.</span></p>

observing their Chaturmasya Sankalpam on the banks of river Tambirabarani and it will be
our bhaagyam to get their blessings.</span></p>

Asramam from July 24th onwards. H.H. had a well-earned rest for nearly eight weeks due to
the restrictions on His movements during the Sankalpam period. As usual H.H. immersed
Himself in His books, (existing stocks and newly procured!) had Chintana with great
Scholars on certain core issues of our Sampradayam.</font></span></h1>

<h1><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight: normal"><font
face="Arial">The Trustees/ Staff/ Committee Members of our Sripuram Asramam had made
excellent arrangements for the Sankalpam, so H.H. had a very comfortable stay for these
eight weeks, many Sishyas and Abhimanis had the Bhagyam of His Darshan; many Sishyas had
Pancha Samskaram and Atma Samarpanam (Saranagathi) during this period. There were Tele
Upanyasams on the series &#147;Sthothra Rathnam&#148; of Srimad YAmunamuni to our overseas
audience.&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></h1>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"><span
style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight: normal"><font
face="Arial">H.H. celebrated the Thirunakshatrams of His Poorvacharyas, their Holinesses
Srimad Vazhuthoor Andavan, Srimad Therazhundur Andavan, Srimad Akkur Andavan, Srimad
Thenbirai Andavan and Srimad Mysore Andavan at the Sripuram Asramam with Veda/ Prabandha/
Grantha Parayanams. On 16/09/2002, H.H. inaugurated and blessed the project at Jayanagar
Asramam for the boys&#146; hostel therein. The same day the Maha Samprokshanam of the
Rajagopuram of Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple at Rajaji Nagar was performed in the immediate
presence of H.H. Srimad Andavan. On the 21st September H.H. performed Mangalasasanam at
Sri Lakshmi Narasimhan Sannathi at the Ahobila Mutt at Prakash Nagar. &nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"><span
style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight: normal"><font
face="Arial">The Sripuram Asramam gave an unprecedented &amp; very well deserved
Sambavanai to all the Kainkaryaparas of H.H. at the end of the Sankalpam. This was a
matter of extreme satisfaction to the Staff and the National Committee. It is hoped that
the other Centres match or better this in the years to come. These Kainkaryaparas are our
unsung warriors, there is a wrong impression due to their noise levels and they are
sometimes difficult to handle. But the job requirements are very strenuous, suitable hands
are difficult to recruit, most people go for Upadhyayam or for Cooking in marriages/ other
functions where there is very good money to be earned. Under the circumstances, (taking an
overall view and leaving out a couple of black sheep who have been sacked anyway) the
their sincere services rendered are to be appreciated and well rewarded. I am very happy
that the Sripuram Asramam Committee has done so and would like to record my appreciation
thereof. I appeal to all centres to replicate this whenever H.H. Srimad Andavan camps at
their centres.</font></span></p>

the addition of Kalyana Mandapam and due to the flocking of large number of Sevarthis
without differentiation of caste and creed. The Aradhanams and the daily rituals, the
Utsavams are conducted with total religious fervour and commitment by the Aradhakar duly
supported by the Committee members from the beginning. As per the Niyamanam of H.H. Srimad

Kalyana Mandapam of 9250 Sq.Ft and 2600 Sq.Ft of Asramam/ Veda Patasala. The strong influx
of the Vidyarthis very soon after the Veda Patasala was inaugurated made us to realise
that the single floor accommodation of 2600 Sq.Ft. was inadequate. The writer thereafter
secured the permission of H.H. to put up the first floor also of 2600 Sq.Ft. straightaway.
The soil was pure sand being in the vicinity of a river; so we had to put up a heavy full
width R.C.C. Strip foundation for the entire length of the excavated trenches all-round
and across.<span style="mso-spacerun:

published in the Paduka of Dec. 2002. It is planned to start the second batch in Nov./
Dec. 2003 and admit a further 24/30 Vidyarthis. We have gratefully acknowledged the
gesture of the family of our H.H&#146;s disciples who had offered their ancestral family
property for putting up the accommodation for the next batch of Vidyarthis. It is now
planned to take up the construction of appr. 1800 Sq.Ft. in the ground floor and 600 Sq.Ft
in the first floor (for accommodating the family of the Donors when they visit Vaduvur).
ARR of Secunderabad Asramam is preparing the building plans (he is a Civil Engineering
Consultant). This is expected to cost Rs. 8.00 lakhs of which a philanthropist has offered
to contribute Rs. 6.00 lakhs. We have to find the balance Rs. 2.00 lakhs only. The
construction will be completed by Nov. 2003.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Our
Ganapati Swami has decided to do the construction on his own departmentally as he is not
happy in incurring the cost of the Contractor&#146;s profit and thus we should complete
the works @ Rs. 325/ 350 per Sq.Ft.! He will procure the construction materials and engage
the labour direct.</font></span></h2>

These Trustees had visited our Asramam on 13th March 2003, paid their reverential respects

to put up an Asramam building of appr. 2400 Sq.Ft. costing appr. Rs. 9.00 Lakhs, within

generated very good publicity for this Kshetram. Though this Kshetram is well known, there
is a need to provide facilities for the Sevarthis. The nearest Railway points are
Vijayawada or Secunderabad; by road it is 220 kms and 115 kms respectively from
Secunderabad &amp; Vijayawada. Even so there is no lodging facility of a standard that
most of us expect; there is a &#147;Brahmin (?) Mess&#148; but really the Sevarthis will
find it very convenient when we put up our Asramam, offer good Thadheearadhanam and decent
accommodation say of our Oppiliappan Koil Asramam level. This will increase the traffic
and create good mileage for the Asramam when we provide these facilities.</font></span></p>

plot to build a second Asramam in the Twin cities. The Asramam in West Marredpally is
ideally and centrally located but reels under a severe (well) water shortage! Asramam has
this unbending policy of conducting the Aradhanams/ Thirumanjanam/ Thaligai etc., with
well water (&amp; drawn by hand) only!! It is a classic case of the irresistible force and
the immovable object &#150; something has got to give!&nbsp;</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"><span

face="Arial">At the same time, the devotion of the all classes of Sishyas and Abhimanis in
the Twin cities is so sublime that we cannot deprive them of the Bhagyam of the visits and
blessings of the Acharya just because of the well water problem. Thus we have to solve the
problem by moving out to a location where we can get well water, build another Asramam,
ensure that H.H. visits the Twin cities regularly and enable the Sevarthis therein to
receive the boundless Blessings of H.H. Srimad Andavan.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

Blessings, we hope that the next visit of H.H. will be to the new Asramam. If, due to the
Grace of the Lord of the Universe, the well water position at our existing Asramam
improves, well &amp; good, so be it, H.H. will stay in both the Asramams during His visit.
This is also an important element in the plans of H.H. to expand the Asramam Network in
other States. There has been a long-standing grievance (partly justified) that we have
been expanding only within Tamizhnadu. The construction of three Asramams in A.P. will be
an appropriate response and will also increase the numbers of Sevarthis frequenting the
Asramams. In fact our long-term vision for the Asramam includes a centre at the Temple
Town of Bhadrachalam also.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

of H.H. Srimad Andavan, we have formally inagurated the &quot;Srimad Andavan Veda
Patasala&quot; on Sunday the 27th October 2002 at Thiruchanur. During June 2002, we had
purchased a plot measuring exactly 6 grounds to build i) an Asramam cum Veda Patasala
&amp; ii) a Kalyana Mandapam, a project estimated to cost Rs. 65.00 lakhs including the
cost of land. Tenders had been floated for the construction from leading civil contractors

auspicious date was fixed by our Asthana Ganapati Swamin, the local Trustee Sri
Chakravarthi &amp; our Sama Veda Pundit Sri Soundararajan were entrusted with the job of
organising the start up. They have done this admirably, have fixed up the Rikhwikhs for
teaching the Vidhyarthis, have given wide publicity in many parts of Andhra Pradesh to
recruit the Vidhyarthis, have taken a new house on lease for a very reasonable rent of
Rs.2500/- p.m., have made all the arrangements for commencing the classes, the
mobilisation of the Vidhyarthis started on the the Vijayadasami Day (15th October) and
organised the inauguration very competently on the 27th October. The Srikaryam Swami, many

strength to over 110 vidyarthis, we are scheduled to start the fifth Patasala at
Thiruvahindrapuram very soon, the Asramam building is not fully ready and this is
