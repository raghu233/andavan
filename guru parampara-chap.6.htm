<p><sup><font face="comic sans ms"><font size="2"><b>This mahan was born in the
year sarvadhari (1828), in the month of Karthigai in a hamlet called
velliyanallur. His janma nakshatram is Magam. He belonged to satamarshana gothra.
His father, Sri Krishna Thathacharya. named his son as Srinivasaraghavan. It is
a great coincidence that two other Acharyas in this illustrious lineage who
adorned the peetam were also named as Srinivasaraghavan in their poorvasramam
namely Srimath Periandavan who was Srimath Chinnandavan’s direct predecessor
and the other Acharya was none other than the famous Srimath Thirukkudanthai
Andavan who was instrumental in spreading the Periasrama parampara to length and
breadth of the country and made it reach dizzy heights of glory in our
sampradaya.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="comic sans ms" size="2"><b>Sri Krishna Thathacharya performed
upayanam and other vaithika samskarams to his son at the right age.
SrinivasarAghavan swami also underwent veda adhyayanam and learnt kavya alankara
grantham. He went to Mysore. And There He met SriRama Sastri who was the Asthana
vidwan of the Mysore raja samsthanam. He learnt nyaya sastras and advaita
philosophy under his tutelage and thus became an exponent With his radiant
brilliance. he even cleared the doubts Sri sastri encountered on sastraic
research and earned his awe and accolades. In particular, swami was extremely
proficient in tharka sastras. He went to Srirangam in pursuit of the studying
ampradhaya granthas and reached the holy hermitage of Srimath Periandavan who
was the paragon of Gnana and vairaghya and prayed at His holy feet for the same.
Observing Srinivasaraghavan Swami, Srimath Periandavan was very much pleased
with His modesty and His sastraic knowledge and accepted Him as His sishya. He
rendered Grantha chathustayam ( namely Srimath Rahasya thraya saram, Geetha
Bhashyam, Sri Bhashyam and bhagavath vishayam) and satha dhooshani to
Srinivasaraghavan. Srinivasaraghavan swami went back to vellianallur after
completing the kalakshepam. i</b></font></p>

<p><font face="comic sans ms" size="2"><b>When swami was in vellianallur
observing his panca kala anushtanams and leading a very regimented life of a
true srivaishnava paramAikanthi, Srimath Periandavan due to His severe penance
and austere life, became very weak.. For the sampradaya to continue to flourish
and grow, Srimath Periandavan wanted to choose His successor .After
makingseveral tests,Peria Andavan decided that Srinivasaraghavan swami was the
right person to succeed Him as the acharya of the periasramam. In the meantime,
Periandavan’s health deteriorated.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="comic sans ms" size="2"><b>Srinivasaraghavan swami went back to
Srirangam from vellianallur and prostated before srimath periandavan and prayed
to him that he be granted sanyasa. With great modesty, he went through the
explanation of qualification of oneself to take up sanyasa thereby indicating
his readiness for the same. swAmi told srimath periandavan that he did &quot;Sarvasanga
parithyagam&quot;, completely renouncing samsara bhandham and prayed to Srimath
periandavan to grant Him sanyasa. Srimath periandavan was filled with extreme
happiness to have chosen the right successor and granted Srinivasaraghavan
swami, sanyasa on an auspicious day. He was given the title &quot;Sri Paduka
sevaka ramanuja maha desikan&quot;.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="comic sans ms" size="2"><b>Since both were Acharyas together at
the same time, they were fondly called as periandavan and chinnandavan by the
sishyas and admirers alike. This period lasted for a very short duration though
with Srimath periandavan reaching parama padam within 4 months of Srimath
chinnandavan taking up sanyasa.</b></font></p>
