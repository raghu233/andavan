<p align="center"><u><strong><font color="#FF0000">(Sri Desika Bhakta Rathna&nbsp; Nallur
Srinivasa Raghavachariar)</font></strong></u></p>

<p>The concept of the Absolute as the saririn (all-Self) of all beings, who is also
immanent in His creation, thereby spiritualising them, is the most inspiring and enduring
element of Visishtadvaita philosophy which finds application in the spirit of service
(Kainkarya). With its innate genius in seeing God in all beings indcluding the sub-human
species, spiritual kinship according to vaishnavam encompasses all. It is indeed
remarkablethat <b>Sri N Srinivasa Raghavachariar</b> imbibed the very essence of this
tradition in which he hails, from even in his youth and made it the guiding principles of
his life, which earned him the sobriquet <b>&quot;Seva Swami&quot;</b>. </p>

<p>Born in April 1923, at Nallur (Tiruvannamalai District) in hte lineage of Appullar, the
maternal uncle of Vedanta Desika, he had his formal education in Sri Venkateswara College
Tirupathi, and traditional scriptural training under scholars like Uttamur
Viraraghavachariar, D.T. Thathachariar and Navalpakkam Narasimha Thathayarya Mahadesikan.
By virtue of their orthodoxy <br>
and performance of the yajnas, Seva Swami's immediate predecessors earned the prefix
&quot;Asthogadhwari&quot; to their names. </p>

<p>He started his career as a Sanskrit teacher in 1946 but his heart was set on what
eventually became his life's mission - selfless service to the cause of Srivaishnava
Sampradhaya especially that of Vedanta Desika's. The same year with the encouragement
given by a scholar, he founded the Vadihamsambuda Maha Desika Sabha and launched the
monthly religious journal &quot;Sri Desika Seva&quot; in 1948, devoted to popularising
Srivaishnava philosophy and religion, of which he continues to be the editor. </p>

<p>Seva Swami's sting in the literary field started around the same time and proficient as
he is in five languages, - Tamil, Sanskrit, English, Telugu and Hindi - he took to writing
seriously and has several works to his credit, both original kavyas, stotras, and
commentaries on Desika's compositions. Another important work he undertook was the
translation of the Sampradaya literature into other languages. Notable among his original
works, which happen to be his masterpieces, are his Sanskrit works, <b>&quot;Venkata
natheeyam&quot;</b> on Lord Venkateswara and <b>&quot;Varadabidana Sahasram&quot;</b> on
Lord Varadaraja in 1008 and 1000 verses respectively. Among his commentaries, that on
Desika's <b>&quot;Yadavabhyudhanam&quot;</b> is a marathon project running into several <br>
volumes. </p>

<p>His social committment expressed itself in several activities of which the more
important are his publication of the yearly alamanac<b> &quot;Sri Desika Darsana
diary&quot;</b> personal maintenance of the temple Mani Mantapam at Villivakkam, Chennai,
the nerve centre of his various social and religious activities which had been blessed by
the visit of many jeeyars and eminent people, and the founding of Sri Vendanta Desika
Research centre for fostering spiritual values in the younger generation. Besides, he has
been conducting classes in Smapradaya texts and stotras and also giving traditional
discourses for the past 50 years under the auspices of several institutions. </p>

<p>Honours and awards have come to him over the years and many institutions all over the
country notable among them being the conferment of the titles Sahita Ratna, Vidya Vinotha,
Desika Rakshamani, Daya sevaka, Desika Bhaktha Ratnam, Samskrutha Prachara chatura,
Tiruppavai Thoomani etc., and the President's award for contribution to Sanskrit
literature in 1992. </p>

<p>Mention must be made about his singular contribution of publishing a different stotra
of Desika with meaning everyday during Desika's seventh Centenary celebrations and the
commemoration volume brought out on that occasion remains a testimony to his erudition and
versatility. </p>

<p align="center">Age has not withered Seva Swami's indomitable spirit to accomplish as
much as possible to further his cherished goal. He is now engaged in translating
Nammazhvar's <b>&quot;Thiruvaimozhi&quot;</b> in Sanskrit in 1000 verses and has promoted
a unique campaign <b>&quot;Tirmaligai Thorum Desikan&quot;</b> to enable devotees to have
the privilege of hosting the idol of Desika in their residences to offer cermonial
worship, during the course of this year. His admirers have planned to celebrate his 76th
Thirunakshathram which falls on April 12. This happens to coincide with the completion of
50 years of his service to Desika Sampradaya. As reported by Sudhakshina Rangaswami <font COLOR="#3333FF">.</font> </p>
