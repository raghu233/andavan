Swami Desikan was born in the month of Purattasi, in the vibhava year according to Tamil Almanac in the nakshathra was Shravanam, the sacred nakshatram of ThiruvenkatamudayAn. The infant was given the name Venkatanathan by his parents, Anathasuri and Thotharamba. Samskaras or ceremonies like Jatakarma, Namakarana, anna prAsana and shauLa were all conducted to the boy, by their parents at appropriate years. Venkatanatha grew up in the atmosphere of devotion to Bhagavan and his bhakthas.<br />
It was a memorable day in the life of Venkatanatha at the age of five. His uncle Appullar took him to the temple of Varadaraja where his Acharya Nadadur Ammal was expounding Sri Bhashya to his disciples. The disciples, who were so much absorbed in the appearance of the boy, forgot the trend of the lesson. When asked by NadAdur Ammal to his disciples where he left the kAlakshebham, the young boy, with the permission of the teacher Kidambi AppuLLAr lisped out the words to the surprise of all. Nadadur Ammal was so much pleased by the boy&rsquo;s intelligence that he blessed him with long life, great knowledge, and worldwide reputation.<br />
At the age of 7, Upanayanam was conducted for venkatanathan. From that time Appullar took charge of the education of the boy Venkatanathan. Venkatanathan was initiated with Sri Vainateya manthra by his uncle, who began teaching sasthras and the vedas. He also studied Tarka and Mimamsa and acquired mastery over other systems of philosophies. Due to the constant meditation on Lord Hayagreeva, Lord Hayagreeva was pleased and bestowed Venkatanathan the great virtue of nectar of knowledge..<br />
When he was residing at Kanchi, His unique gifts of poetics and dialectics earned him the name of Kavitharkika simham. His sovereignty in the field Vedantha earned him the title of Vedanthacharya. His sishyas called him Swami Desikan. He channeled all his varied powers, to establish Sri Ramanujas systems on firm and secure foundations, rendering it ever impregnable to adverse attacks.<br />
Swamy Desikan has authored over a hundred works in number both Sanskrit and Tamil. Sthothra granthas (28), Kavya granthas (4), Natakam(1), Vedhantha Granthas (14), VyAkyA granthas (8), Anushtana granthas (2), Rahasya Granthas(32) and Tamil Prabhandams (32).

29. GOPALARYA MAHA DESIKAN&mdash;MUNITHRAYA SAMPRADHAYA PRAVARTHAKAR<br />
Purattasi-Pooradam is the thirunakshatram of Srimath Thirukkudanthai Desikan (1700 - 1781) also known as GopAlArya MahAdEsikan. He is an important Acharya in the Munithraya sampradayam. His thanian reads as &#160;<br />
Sri Krishna dEsika PadAmbuja Brunga rAjam&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8232;VEdAntha lakshmana muneeindra kripatha bOtham&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8232;Thraiantha dEesika yatheendra satAri moorthim&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8232;Gopala dEsika sikAmanim Aasrayamaha<br />
Srimathe Gopalarya Mahadesikaya Namaha&#160;&#160;<br />
Sri Gopala Desikan was born in Aathreya gothram in Sri Appullar's Vamsam (Swami Desikan's maternal uncle). The kootasthar of this Vamsam Sri Kidambi Aachaan (also known as madaippalli Aachaan) was doing the Madaippalli kainkaryam to Sri Ramanuja. Thirukkudanthai Gopala Desikan was the direct and fifteenth descendant of Appullar. Swami's Avatharam took place in Vikrama Varusham (1700) purattasi madham, pooradam star, sukla paksham, navami thithi in dhanur lagnam. Swami received his pancha samaskaram and veda adhyanam from his father Sri Krishna Suri. From his father, he also learnt tharkam, vyakaranam, meemamsam, Divya Prabhandham, Desika Prabhandham &amp; Sthothra paatams of Sri NigamAntha MahA dEsikan and became an erudite scholar.<br />
Sri Gopala Desikan requested Saakshaath swami to bless him and take him as a sishya. Saakshath swami, after testing his gnanam, anushtanam and bhakthi was immensely pleased and blessed him and accepted him as his sishya. Sri Gopala Desikan studied Srimath Rahasyathraya Saaram, Sri Bhaashyam, Geethaa Bhaashyam, Sri Paancharaathra Prabruthi, Anushtaana Granthas, Sruthaprakaasikaa, Thaathparya Chandrikaa, Sathadooshani, Thathva mukthaa kalaabaa, Nyasavidyaa Darpana and Sri Thathva Sidhanjanam under the holy feet of Saakshaath swami. Saakshath swami instructed Sri Gopala Desikan to learn Bhagavath Vishayam from his Satheerthar and disciple Sri Paduka Sevaka Ramanuja muni, who had learnt 24 Ayirappadi earlier from Sri Saakshath swami. As instructed, Sri Gopala dEsikan studied Bhagavath Vishayam from Padhuka Sevaka Ramanuja muni and became a scholar in that too, and requested Sri Saakshaath swami for Bharasamarpanam. Saakshaath swami was very much pleased at his request and perfromed Prapatti for Sri Gopala Desikan at the sacred feet of Lord Sri Ranganatha through Acharya nishtai. &#160;<br />
When he offered prayers with AparyabdhAmritha Dhyana slokam to Lord at Thirukkudanthai. Lord Aravamudhan appeared through archakar and granted the name&#160;Thirukkudanthai Desikan<br />
Other works of swami are Ahniga Grantham, Sri Desika sahasranamam, Nikshepa Chinthamani also known as Saranaagathi Saasthra Vivaranam, Sangraha Vyaakyaanams for Kanninun Siruththambu, Thiruppallandu, Sri Jayanthi Nirnayam, Aparyabdhamritha Dhyana sopanam on Araavamudhan (similar to Bhagavath Dhyana sopanam of Swami Desikan on Lord Ranganatha) One day Lord Aparyabdhamudhan appeared in the dream of Thirukudanthai Desikan and told him that three yatheeswas, the Amsa avatharams of Sri Nathamuni, Sri Alavanthar, and Sri Bashyakarar will come and request him to take them as his sishyas and instructed him to accept them as his sishyas and teach them the Munithraya sath-sampradayam, the sampradayam passed down by three munis namely Nathamuni, Yamunamuni and Ramanuja Muni. Similarly Lord appeared in the dream of the three swamis also, and told them to take up Thureeyasramam and become sishyas of Thirukkudanthai Desikan swami. The three swamis were:<br />
Sri Srinivasa Maha Desikan of Cheyyanam on the banks of Tamirabarani river Sri Ranganatha Maha Desikan of Vathiraairuppu, Thirumaliruncholai near Madurai Sri Vedantha Ramanuja Maha Desikan of Vazhuthur, a small village near Thirukkudanthai. Thirukkudanthai Desikan swami took all three of them as his sishyas and taught them all the granthas through upadesams and kalakshebams. One day during Adhyayanothsavam Sarrumurai time when swami, along with the three sishyas did mangalasaasanam at Amudhan sannidhi, Lord Amudhan through Archamukam, awarded the thirunamam&#160;&quot;MUNITHRAYA SAMPRADHAYA PRAVARTHAKAR&quot;&#160;to Srimath Thirukkudanthai Desikan. Swami accepted it with humility saying, &quot;Naayindhen, DhanyOsmi&quot;. Swami instructed the yatheeswaras to do sampradhaya pravachanam from their respective places. The yatheeswaras returned back to their villages. Of these yatheeswaras,<br />
Srimath Thirukkudanthai Desikan led a life of Acharya in gruhasthashrama for almost all of his life like Swami Desikan. He took up sanyasam at the age of 81 years (In Plava year 1781, Karthigai month on Pushya star-Krishna panchami) with the name Aparyabdhaamridha Maha Desikan. The very next day, in Plava varusham Karthigai month- Krishna sashti (1781 Nov/Dec) Srimath Thirukkudanthai Desikan breathed his last at Thirukkudanthai and adorned Thirunadu<br />

Vazhuthur Andavan - was born in the month of Avani with Pooratadhi as his nakshathram in the tamil year Rudrothkari ( 1744-1745 AD) to Srinivasachar in Vazhuthur.<br />
He took sanyAsam from the then Paduka Sevaka Ramanuja Maha Desikan, and became a fitting successor to Sri Thirukkudanthai Desikan with the name Srimad VEdhantha Ramanuja Maha Desikan also called as Vazhuthur Andavan and lived in a small hut on the southern bank of coleroon doing sidhantha pravachanam at srirangam.<br />
&#160;<br />
Many bhagavathas became sishyas of Srimath Vazhuthur Vedhantha Ramanuja Maha Desikan during these pravachanams. It is told that Sri Gopalarya Maha Desikan blessed Vazhuthur swamy that &quot;Neeray num sampradhaayathai Aala vandha Andavan&quot; meaning you alone are going to guard, rule and spread our sampradhaayam&quot;. From that day he was known to be called as Vazhuthur Andavan and sampradhaayam was called as&#160;Srimath Aandavan Asramam Sampradhaayam.&#160;&#160;&#8232;&#8232;From Him, sampradhaayam spreaded through his disciples to many branches. Prominent among them are as follows:<br />
 1. Srinivasa Ramanuja Maha Desikan - Thiruthuraipoondi Andavan also known as Vilakkudi andavan (Andavan asramam)<br />
 2. Annarya Maha Desikan - also known as Navalpakkam Swamy who was in gruhasthasramam spreading sampradhayam at Thirukkudanthai, Thiruvaheendapuram and Navalpakkam.<br />
 3. Vangipuram Vedhantha Ramanuja Maha desikan (Aandikadu Swamy in Srirangam)<br />
&#8232;Through these 3 acharyas who were sishyas of Srimath Vazhuthur Andavan, the sampradhaayam has spread to a very great extent like a big banyan tree.&#160;&#160;&#8232;In the next Chapter, adiyEn will&#160;continue with&#160;the history of achAryAs starting with Srimath Thirutthuraippoondi Andavan.<br />

He learnt sampradhaya granthas fromVazhuthur&#8232;Andavan and . became an erudite scholar and authentic exponent of&#8232;Srivaishnava philosophy. ,, .He had prapatti done at the feet of&#8232;almighty and was initiated into Dureeyasraman by Vazhuthur Andavan&#8232;and was named &quot;, Srinivasa ramanuja Maha Desikan, one of the&#8232;illustrious Acharyas of Srirangam Srimath Andavan PeriAsramam. .&#8232;Thirutthuraippoondi Andavan was also known as vilakkudi andavan as&#8232;he hailed from vilakkudi, a small hamlet near Rajamannargudi .&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Srimath Periandavan (Srimath Srinivasa Mahadesikan)&#8232;&#8232;Thirunakshatram: Masi &ndash; Pushyam&#8232;&#8232;Thanian&#8232;&#8232;Sri rangesha padhe samarpitha Bharam sruthyantha ramanuja&#8232;&#8232;Sri yogeendra guruththamena yaminash sruththyantha vidhyathmana:&#8232;&#8232;PrAptha sruthya vathamsa yughma hrudhayam Srivasa ramanujath&#8232;&#8232;Sri Srivasa muneendra desika manim sreyo nidhim samsraye&#8232;&#8232;Thirutthuraipoondi Andavan gave sanyasam to Sri&#8232;Srinivasaraghavachariar Swami who went on to become one of&#8232;illustrious Acharyas of Munitraya Sampradayam, and unparalled among&#8232;His contemporaries. This mahan later came to be known as the famous&#8232;Srimath Periandavan.&#8232;&#8232;SrinivasaRaghavan was born on 25.2.1801 in the year Roudri (Masi-&#8232;pushyam) in a village called Piliyaranai near Kanchipuram. At a&#8232;tender age of 10, he mastered rendering of Sama Veda learnt from his&#8232;father, Sri Krishnamachariar which was considered to be an invaluable&#8232;wealth in his family traditions.&#8232;&#8232;Sri Krishnamachariar was extremely pleased with his son's progress&#8232;and took the young boy back to Kanchi . There, SrinivasaRaghavan&#8232;learnt Nyaya &ndash; Meemamsa- Vyakarana Sastras under the tutelage of&#8232;great scholars. Thereafter he went to Srirangam to see Srirangam&#8232;Swami (Srimath Vazhutoor Andavan) and prayed for Saranagathi.&#8232;Srimath Andavan , performed Atma samarpanam ( saranagathi) to him in&#8232;front of Lord Sri Ranganatha's sannidhi.&#8232;&#8232;He went to Srirangam Swami and prayed to him that Swami perform&#8232;kalakshepams to him on sampradayic granthams.. Thirutthuraipoondi&#8232;Andavan took Agnya from Swami in carrying out this holy task and&#8232;performed kalakshepams to Srinivasaraghavan on Grantha&#8232;chatushtayam,Rahasyams and Rahasyarthas.&#8232;&#8232;SrinivasaRaghavan gained exemplary knowledge in all that learnt from&#8232;his Acharya. After some time, he prayed to Srimath Thirutthuraipoondi&#8232;Andavan for the Dureeyasramam. As his near and dear objected to this,&#8232;Srimath Andavan also felt that SrinivasaRaghavan be a gruhasta for&#8232;some more time before taking up sanyAs and blessed him to go back to&#8232;Kanchi.&#8232;&#8232;In His gruhastasrama, SrinivasaraghavswAmi was blessed with a girl&#8232;and He immediately felt that He had fulfilled his duties as a&#8232;gruhasta. When Srinivasaraghavan swami went to Srirangam and prayed&#8232;with thirutthuraipoondi Andavan for sanyasa, Swami tested Him in&#8232;various ways to see whether He was ready to take up sanyasa .&#8232;After getting convinced, Swami granted sanyasam to Srimath&#8232;Periandavan and he was given the title &quot;Srinivasa maha desikan&quot;.&#8232;Since this mahan was so popular among his sishyas and admirers alike,&#8232;he was fondly called as periandavan. For a long time he was residing&#8232;in Srirangam . In a month, He would go to devout and pious&#8232;Srivaishnava bhagavathas' thiru maligai on selected seven to eight&#8232;days for unccha Vritthi . He would take the grains to the banks of&#8232;Coleroon river, wash them in the river water, cook them and eat the&#8232;bhagavath prasadham along with thulasi leaves. On other days, he used&#8232;to powder the dry leaves fallen from the Holy Fig tree and consume&#8232;the same. Such was his Vairaghyam.&#8232;&#8232;Sishya paramapara:- He remained deeply dedicated to the sampradayam&#8232;and placed Srimad Andavan sampradayam on a firm footing and as a&#8232;beacon light to thirsty aspirants. Upon Lord Ranganatha's command to&#8232;take disciples, and disseminate and propagate the Philosophy, several&#8232;persons became His Disciples, and became erudite scholars and&#8232;preceptors. Some of them were&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;1) Thirupputkuzhi Appa 2) Mannargudi Gopalanna 3) Vyakaranam&#8232;Rangachariar 4) Meemisal Narasimhachariar 5) Chinnamu Rangachariar 6)&#8232;Thirunelveli Gopalasamudram Narayanachariar 7) Shamala Chakravarthi&#8232;and 8) Purisai Nadathur Rangachariar.&#8232;&#8232;Sri Srinivasa Raghavachariar's (Periandavan's) asrama sweekaram took&#8232;place around 1828. He observed Chathurmasyams for 55 years and he&#8232;adorned thirunadu in subhanu varusham thai masam - krishna&#8232;thrayodhasi thithi(1884-Jan-Feb)&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;In the next posting, adiyEn will cover the history of achAryAs&#8232;starting with Srimath Chinnandavan.&#8232;&#8232;Srimath Andavan Thiruvadi - Perungadambanur Parthasarathy Sreenivasan (of Besant Nagar,Chennai)&#8232;<br />

Acharya parampara of Srimath Andavan Ashramam continues in this posting with&#160;Srimath Chinnandavan - Sri Paduka Sevaka Ramanuja Mahadesikan<br />
Srimath Chinnandavan<br />
Thirunakshatram: Karthigai - Magam&#160;Thaniyan:<br />

Karthigai - Magam is the thirunakshtram day of one of the foremost and illustrious acharyas of Srirangam Srimath Andavan Periasramam, Srimath Chinnandavan - Sri Paduka Sevaka ramanuja maha desikan.<br />
This mahan was born in the year sarvadhari (1828), in the month of Karthigai in a hamlet called velliyanallur. His janma nakshatram is Magam. He belonged to satamarshana gothra. His father, Sri Krishna Thathacharya. named his son as Srinivasaraghavan. It is a great coincidence that two other Acharyas in this illustrious lineage who adorned the peetam were also named as Srinivasaraghavan in their poorvasramam namely Srimath Periandavan who was Srimath Chinnandavan&rsquo;s direct predecessor and the other Acharya was none other than the famous Srimath Thirukkudanthai Andavan who was instrumental in spreading the Periasrama parampara to length and breadth of the country and made it reach dizzy heights of glory in our sampradaya.<br />
Younger days of Srimath Chinnandavan<br />
Sri Krishna Thathacharya performed upayanam and other vaithika samskarams to his son at the right age. SrinivasarAghavan swami also underwent veda adhyayanam and learnt kavya alankara grantham. He went to Mysore. And There He met SriRama Sastri who was the Asthana vidwan of the Mysore raja samsthanam. He learnt nyaya sastras and advaita philosophy under his tutelage and thus became an exponent With his radiant brilliance. he even cleared the doubts Sri sastri encountered on sastraic research and earned his awe and accolades. In particular, swami was extremely proficient in tharka sastras. He went to Srirangam in pursuit of the studying ampradhaya granthas and reached the holy hermitage of Srimath Periandavan who was the paragon of Gnana and vairaghya and prayed at His holy feet for the same. Observing Srinivasaraghavan Swami, Srimath Periandavan was very much pleased with His modesty and His sastraic knowledge and accepted Him as His sishya. He rendered Grantha chathustayam ( namely Srimath Rahasya thraya saram, Geetha Bhashyam, Sri Bhashyam and bhagavath vishayam) and satha dhooshani to Srinivasaraghavan. Srinivasaraghavan swami went back to vellianallur after completing the kalakshepam. i<br />
Taking up sanyasa<br />
When swami was in vellianallur observing his panca kala anushtanams and leading a very regimented life of a true srivaishnava paramAikanthi, Srimath Periandavan due to His severe penance and austere life, became very weak.. For the sampradaya to continue to flourish and grow, Srimath Periandavan wanted to choose His successor .After makingseveral tests,Peria Andavan decided that Srinivasaraghavan swami was the right person to succeed Him as the acharya of the periasramam. In the meantime, Periandavan&rsquo;s health deteriorated.<br />
Srinivasaraghavan swami went back to Srirangam from vellianallur and prostated before srimath periandavan and prayed to him that he be granted sanyasa. With great modesty, he went through the explanation of qualification of oneself to take up sanyasa thereby indicating his readiness for the same. swAmi told srimath periandavan that he did &quot;Sarvasanga parithyagam&quot;, completely renouncing samsara bhandham and prayed to Srimath periandavan to grant Him sanyasa. Srimath periandavan was filled with extreme happiness to have chosen the right successor and granted Srinivasaraghavan swami, sanyasa on an auspicious day. He was given the title &quot;Sri Paduka sevaka ramanuja maha desikan&quot;.<br />
Since both were Acharyas together at the same time, they were fondly called as periandavan and chinnandavan by the sishyas and admirers alike. This period lasted for a very short duration though with Srimath periandavan reaching parama padam within 4 months of Srimath chinnandavan taking up sanyasa.<br />
Srimath chinnandavan was serving as guiding light of the sampradaya and authored rarest of several granthas when he was the Acharya of the periasramam- They are as follows:<br />
 1. 1. Ahnikartha prakasikai 2.Sri Jayanthi nirnayam 3.ukthyacharya nishta vicharam 4.sathpadha rakshai 5. Janmashtami nirnayam ..6.thathkrathu nyaya vicharam.7.Acharya sambavanai kramam...8.Aasowcha sangam&#8232;Sishya parampara:- Several erudite scholars became the disciples of srimath chinnandavan, foremost being:- 1.Eyunni SriVaradhachar swamy(who later became Terazhundur Andavan) 2 Sri Villiputhur Ammalachar swami 3.Vidvan ukkur Srinivasaraghavachar.4.Akkur Srinivasaraghavachar. 5..Vidvan Tembarai Ramabadrachar&#8232;<br />
Yathra<br />
Srimath chinnandavan traveled to Sri kanchi from Srirangam and gave several sampradayic pravachanams(discourses) during His yathra and came back to Srirangam.<br />
Srimath Chinnandavan attained Thirunadu at the age of 68 leaving behind grieving disciples in the year Vijaya (1895), on the sukla sapthami thithi in the tamil month of Thai. Swami was in thureeyasramam was 10 years observing that many chaturmasyams.<br />

Srimath KAdandhEthi Andavan was born in the Avani month of Virodhi varusham (1829 A.D) in Moolam nakshatram in a village just south of river KAveri called KAdandhEthi to Srimathi Janaki Ammal and Sri RaghunAthAchar. Sri RaghunAthAchar was performing kainkaryam to Srimath Thiruthuraipoondi Andavan, the second Andavan of Srimath Andavan Ashramam. The child was named Sri Varada VedAnthAchAriAr. He was initiated into Brahmacharyam with upanayanam at the prescribed age and was taught vEdAs and upanishads. He learnt Tharka ShAstras in ,RajamannAr Koil under the tutelage of Sri U.Ve. SamiyAchchAr swAmi.<br />
In his young days itself Sri Varada VedAnthAchAriar, with sincere devotion and strong vairAgyam meditated on the sacred Moola manthram, AshtAkshara manthram and gAyathri manthram vigrorously and attained manthra sidhdhi and power. Later he visited Mysore Asthanam and further mastered in tharka shAstrAs from Mysore samasthAna vidwan named Aakki Azhwan. During this period he also received Sri Hayagreeva ManthrOpadEsam from Sri Parakala Jeeyar Swami and Sri Nrusimha ManthrOpaDesam from Sri Ahobila Matam Azhagiyasingar. Thus he attained various manthra sidhdhi and SathAvadAna shakthi at a very young age as a bramhachAri. He mastered the four shAstras and also had poetic prowess as an&#160;&quot;Aasu Kavi&quot;.<br />
Sri Varada VedAnthAchAriar was married at the age of 35. Immediately after his marriage, he started on a yathra and visited various samasthAnams.<br />
At Nagapattinam ,a request from the town&rsquo;s Tashildar Sri Rangaswami Nayakkar, Sri Varada Vedanthachariar swami displayed his Satavadhana skills in Vellipalayam Krishna Sannidhi. (Sathavadanam is a skill where the person performing this skill will tackle 100 questions or acts at the same time). The people were awed by this display. At the end, he asked a palanquin to be brought and he got into the palanquin. He asked it to be lifted only in the back of the palanquin. With his manthra sidhdhi he went on a procession in the palanquin, with no one lifting the front side of the palanquin.<br />
At Thirumala, he was gifted an ivory Planquin as a sanmAnam on one occasion. He later donated this palanquin to Swami Desikan Sannidhi at Thirucherai. He stayed in Thirupati till he completed 60 years.<br />
At Thirukkudanthai<br />
After celebrating his sasthiabdapoorthy at Tirumala, he desired to come and live in Thirukkudanthai. He sold his properties at Tirupathi and came to Thirukkudanthai. He purchased a house in Sri Aravamdhan Sannidhi Street and stayed there. He did many kainkaryams and ubhayams at the sannidhi of Sri Aravamudhan. He was very much devoted to Sri Komalavalli Thaayar and donated a Simha Vahanam for Komalavalli ThAyAr.<br />
Swami&rsquo;s Compositions<br />
Adbudha vAmanam&quot;. Aaraat Prabhandham Swapna Sathakam&quot;&#160;When his eyesight had weakened considerably due to his old age, he composed a grantham called&#160;&quot;Sri Komala Dandakam&quot;&#160;on Thirukkudanthai Komalavalli Thayaar. . By reciting this wonderful grantham he regained his vision completely. HH Kadenthethi Andavan had a special attachment to Komalavalli Thayar.He has given a Gold Karai ( Jewel ) and a Silver Simha vahana to Thayar<br />
Srimath Chinnandavan attained Thirunadu at the age of 68 leaving behind grieving disciples in the year Vijaya (1895), on the sukla sapthami thithi in the tamil month of Thai.. In 1905 after 11 years without acharya, Andavan sishyas went to Thirukkudanthai. Having known the greatness and gnana, anushtana and vairagyam of Sri Varada Vedanthachariar, Andavan Ashramam sishyas went to Thirukkudanthai and requested him to become their Acharya , to continue the Andavan Sampradhayam.<br />
Sri Varada Vedanthachariar was already 76 years old then. He decided to accept the sanyasa ashramam with the intent of satisying the longing of Andavan sishyas for an Acharya and also with the intent of appointing Therezundur Varadachariar as the next Andavan at an appropriate time.<br />
38th pattam Thirukkudanthai Azagiyasingar<br />
He approached 38th pattam Azhagiyasingar Srimath Srinivasa Sadagopa yatheendra Mahadesikan (Thirukkudanthai Azagiyasingar) with other Andavan sishyas and requested him to give sanyasa ashramam to him. Sri Varadha Vedanthachariar accepted the Preksha manthram and sanyasa ashramam from Srimath Azhagiyasingar and became the 6th Andavan of Andavan Ashramam in Avani month of 1905 (Tamil year Visvavasu) at Nrusimhapuram in front of hundreds of sishyas of Andavan Ashramam, Ahobila Matam and srivaishnavas of Tirukkudanthai. He was given the name &quot;Srinivasa Ramanuja Mahadesikan&quot; and was called as Thirukkudanthai Andavan and also as Kadandethi Andavan. An Andavan thiruvadi, Tiruvaheendrapuram Ashtavadani Sri Anathachariar composed and offered the tanian &quot;Srimath SrivAsa yOgi..&quot; for Kadandethi Andavan at the sannidhi of Sri Ranganatha Perumal. But due to his old age, Srimath Andavan used to faint and lose conciousness during pravachanam.<br />
Srimath Nammandavan<br />
In 1908, as Srimath Andavan was getting older and weaker day by day, he decided it was time to hand over the Acharya peetam to Therezhundur swami and communicated this to him through his sishyas. On hearing this, Therezhundur swami rushed to Srirangam leaving his family and properties. He gave all the manthra powers of saptha koti (7 crores) Thiruvastaakshara manthram he had earned to Therezhundur swami and said it will help in his winning over everyone to our sath-sampradayam. He gave preksha manthram and sanyasa ashramam to Theruzhundur swami in Aug 1908 (tamil year Keelakam) and made him the 7th Andavan with title Srimath Vedantha Ramanuja Mahadesikan who was also called as Nammandavan and Therezundur Andavan. After having restored the Andavan Ashramam sampradayam to its glory and after appointing a great avathara pursha like Nammandavan as the succeeding Acharya, Srimath Kadandethi Andavan graced His sishyas in leela vibuti for 6 more months and in early 1909 attained Thirunadu (Tamil year Keelaka, Masi month, Krishna paksham, Dwadasi thithi) after 3 chaturmasyams at the age of 79 years.<br />

Avani poorattadhi is the thirunakshatram of Srimath ThErazhundur Andavan Sri Vedhantha Ramanuja Mahadesikan. His poorvashrama Name was Sri Varadhachar. Sri Varadhachar Swami was born in the year Prajothpathi (1871) in the month of AvaNi in ThErazhundur village in Tanjore district in Tamilnadu. He belonged to Eyunni vamsam and Bharadwaja Gothram. At very early age, he was trained at vedha adhyayanam, kavyam and nataka alankaram at his birth place. To learn TharkA, vyAkaranA, and meemAmsA he went to Srirangam, offered his obeisance at the feet of PeriAndavan who in turn blessed Sri VaradhAchar swami with pancha samskaram and manthra upadesam. Sri VaradAchAr swami learnt Tharka and nyAya sAsthrA from the great scholar Vilakkudi Vedhanthachar swAmi. He under went intensive training under the great pandit pudhu-agrahAram Brahmasri Kuppuswami sastrigal in meemAmsA and vyakaranA. He had performed Atma samarpanam at the holy feet of Nam Perumal by Srimath ChinnAndavan - Srimath Paduka Sevaka Ramanuja Maha Desikan.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
He was married at the age of 18 years to Sowbhagyavathi Sengamala Ammal, daughter of Sri Annasami Ayyangar of&#160;Thirukkudanthai Ayyangar street&#160;. Sri Varadhachar swami became a disciple at the holy feet of Srimath ChinnAndavan - Srimath PAdukA Sevaka Ramanuja Maha Desikan and learnt kalakshEpa grantha chathushtyams from His Holiness, His Holiness Srimath Chinnandavan who was very much impressed with Sri VaradhAchar Swami called him one day and told, &quot;You are going to be the Sampradhaya Pravarthaka of this Asramam&quot; . When Srimath Chinnandavan's health was affected, he longed for a successor for this sampradhaya. Sri VaradAchAr swami, at that young age readily offered himself for the ascetic order. But some concerns were raised from very close circle of Varadhachar swamy. HH adorned thirunadu in Vijaya varusham (1894) in the month of thai without appointing a successor to Asramam. Sri VaradAchAr swami, after completion of Chinnandavan's kainkaryams, purchased a house at Srirangam and lived there with his parents and wife. He visited the Brindavanam of asramam daily, performed ThiruvArAdhanam, and pAdukArAdhanam in morning and offered ThiruviLakku at evening and after all kainkaryams, he used to return home only at night.<br />
&#160;<br />
This was his daily activity for 11 long years from Vijaya varusham 1884 Thai month to Visuvavasu-Avani -1905, when 76 years old Kadanthethi SathavadhAnam Varadha vEdhanthAchAr swami, a disciple of PeriAndavan, was requested by all Andavan Ashramam sishyas and other bhagavathas to take up sanyasam from Thirukkudanthai Srimath Azhagiya singar. . Accordingly Srimath Srinivasa SatakOpa Yatheendra Maha Desikan (38th Jeer of Sri Ahoibila Mutt) who was camping at Nrusimhapuram gave thureeyAsramam to Kadanthethi swAmi in presence of a large Srivaishvaite gathering. Thus 76 year old KAdanthethi swami became the Asrama Head of Srimath Andavan periAsramam as Srinivasa RAmAnuja MahA DEsikan.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
The health of KAdanthEthi Andavan deteriorated during 1905 and all asramam sishyas immediately rushed to Sri VaradAchar swami and requested to take up sanyasam from KAdanthEthi Andavan.&#160;&#160;Sri VaradAchAr swAmi readily acceded to their request by leaving the family to take up ascetic orders. He received thureeyAsramam from the holy hands of KadanthEthi Andavan Srinivasa Ramanuja Maha Desikan in the year KEELAKA VARUSHAM- AVANI MADHAM (sep-oct ,1908 ) and was named Sri VEdAntha RAmAnuja MahA dEsikan- also known as &amp; ThErazhundur Andavan. And NammAndavan. Both AchAryAs were together for a period of 6 months. Srimath KadanthEthi Andavan attained thirunAdu in&#160; &#160;Keelaka varusham-masi madham-krishnapaksham-dwadasi thithi (17.02.1909).&#8232;&#8232;<br />
Ever since Srimath NammAndavan took up sanyasam, His Holiness had assimilated in himself strict austerity, extreme rigid and rigorous routines of a sanyAsi, leading a highly puritan's life of his poorvacharyas, rejecting all luxuries and conveniences. He travelled by walk only like his predecessors observing &quot; pAdhayAthra&quot; to visit holy shrines. Good personality, majestic look, pleasing voice, convincing talk etc were his great traits. His discourses were full of humor , with penetrating perception of holy life of sages Alwars and ArchAvathAras. He attracted all sections of vaishnavite community, vedic scholars and VEdhAnthis, by his philosophic lectures. His deliverance of Sri BAshyA, Bhagavath vishyam and other granthAs, were with such ease and perfection, that they attracted a large gathering around him, wherever he lectured. People in those days used to say that, Peria perumal is namm Perumal, jewel among alwars - is nammAlwAr and jewel among acharyas- is NammAndavan .<br />
Some of the great scholars who studied, swaroopa granthas under His Holiness srimad NammAndavan were:-<br />
&#160;<br />
Sri U.Ve. Rangachar swami (who became Akkur Andavan-Srinivasa Maha Desikan later)<br />
Sri U.Ve.Tenpirai Venkata Raghavachar swami( who became&#160;&#160;Thenbarai Andavan-Sri RanganAtha Maha Desikan later)<br />

&#160;<br />
&#160;His holiness adorned thirunAdu in PRAJOTHPATHI year (1931)-Aadi -Poorattadhi Krishna panchami day,that was on 03.08.1931 at the age 59 years and 11 months shortly before celebrations of His shashti-abtha-poorthi.<br />

&#160;<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Akkur Andavan was&#160;&#160;born in the year 1880&#160;&#160;in the month of Purattasi with Uthirattadhi as his birth star.His poorvasrama name was Rangachariar. He was the immediate successor to Srimad Nammandavan and 7th Peetadhipathy of Srirangam Srimad Andavan Asramam. He had studied sampradhaya granthas at the holy feet of sri Nammandavan along with&#160;Sri U.Ve.Thembarai Venkata Raghavachar swami (who became Tembarai Andavan later) Dimmakudi sri U.Ve .Srinivasachar Thirukkudanthai Vairakya Nidhi Sri U.Ve. Rajagopalachar, Rayampettai GanapAdi Vidwan Seemachar&#160;&#160;and many others<br />
&#160;<br />
In 1931,When Nammandavan's health was very much affcted,&#160;HH wanted to appoint a successor for the Asramam. His Holiness NammAndavan wanted Sri Akkur Rangachar Swami to be his successor. But having influenced by gnanam, vairaghyam, anushtAnam, spiritual powers, and great capabilities of Srimath NamAndavan, Sri Rangachar swami thought that he may not be a fit person to be the successor of Srimath NamAndavan and adorn this great Acharya lineage of Srimath Andavan Ashramam. Sri Rangachar swami hesitated and respectfully declined to take up thureeyashramam at that time. Srimath Andavan was very upset that Sri Rangachar could not be appointed immediately as His Holiness realized His dehAvasanam (end) was nearing. His Holiness offered prayers to the PAdukAs of PoorvAchAryas, and with tears rolling in his eyes, reciting slokas like &quot;Sriman Abeeshta Varadha Thvaam asmi charanam Gatha:&quot; and with Goddess Thayaar as Purusha kAram, His Holiness offered pranams many times at the lotus feet of Lord Varadharaja of Kanchi, and appealed to HIM ,&#8232;&#8232;<br />
&quot;Hey Prabho! you have fulfilled the prayers, of Sri Alavandar by making Sri Ramanuja as the Sampradhaya pravarthakar. Now fulfil my prayer also by making Akkur Rangachar swami, as the sampradhya pravarthakar &amp; my successor, in our Asramam. The responsibility is yours.&quot;<br />
Saying so, He surrendered his burden at the lotus feet of the Lord Varadhan of Kanchi. His holiness adorned thirunAdu.<br />
&#160;<br />
Like AlavandAr's prayer, Srimath NammAndavan's prayer too was granted by Lord Varadha later. Srimath Aakur Rangachar swamy consented to take up sanyasam immediately after Srimath Nammandavan adorned ThirunAdu. Exactly 3 weeks after NammAndavan adorning Thirunadu, Sri Narayana Yatheeswarar, a Disciple of NammAndavan, who had already received Sanyasam from NammAndavan, gave the ochre ascetic robes of sanyasam to Sri Rangachar swami.<br />
&#160;<br />
&#160;SriRangachar swami became the successor of NammAndavan in Andavan asramam as Srimath Akkur Andavan Sri Srinivasa Maha Desikan, the same name as&#160;PeriAndavan and very much like PeriAndavan in Gnaana,&#160;vairagya, anushtaanam etc.. His sancharam in the 15 year period from 1931 was all on foot (paadha yathrA). His holiness Srimad Akkur Andavan covered Tamilnadu, Karnataka and Thirupathi through His paadha yatra and spread Munithraya ashrama sampradyaa.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
Srimad thembarai Andavan and&#160;&#160;Srimath Thirukkudanthai Andavan attended&#160;&#160;the Kalakshebam of&#160;&#160;various&#160;&#160;granthams in their poorvasramam at the holy feet of Srimath Aakkur Andavan. Srimath Akkur Andavan had the blessings of Srimath&#160;&#160;Nammandavan in Completing the Vyakyanam for the remaining 208 slokas of Padhuka sahasram (Srimath Nammandavan had already completed vYAkyanam for about 800 slokas of paduka sahasram, but before completing the balance, he adorned ThirunAdu)&#8232;&#8232;<br />
Once Akkur Andavan had to undergo a surgery to remove a cyst from his chest. He never took any pain killing medicine or anesthesia for the procedure. Instead, he was deeply immersed, in reciting ramayana slokas mentally for getting himself relieved from the pain. He was one of the greatest exponents of Ramayana discourses at his time. People had a very high regard for him for his simplicity, lucid and profound knowledge in sampradhaya and sastras, humourous discourses, etc, and called him as&#160;&quot;&quot;ENGAL ANDAVAN&quot;<br />
&#160;<br />
Thembarai Venkata Raghavachar Swamy was doing kainkaryam to Srimath Akkur Andavan, continuing to undertake kAlakshEpams under His Holiness. Srimath&#160;&#160;Akkur&#160;&#160;Andavan. His Holiness&#160;&#160;was immensely pleased with Thembarai&#160;&#160;swAmi&rsquo;s GnAna, vairAghyA and AnushtAnams and felt that Thembarai Swamy&#160;&#160;was the right person to be adorned as&#160;&lsquo;sampradAya pravarthakA&rsquo;&#160;of periAsramam after His time.&#160;&#160;His Holiness&#160;&#160;Srimad Akkur Andavan informed Thembarai Swamy about his decision. Thembarai Swamy after long thoughts, decided to take up sanyAsam and&#160;&#160;gave his consent to his Holiness. Srimath Andavan was extremely pleased byThembarai&#160;&#160;swAmi&rsquo;s decision and ordained His sishyAs to make arrangements for the Holy ceremony.<br />
&#160;<br />
On 06.10.1946,&#160;&#160;&#160;Srimath Akkur Andavan gave the holy sanyAsam to Sri. U.Ve. Brahmaniddhi Thembarai VenkatarAghavAchAriar swami&#160;&#160;in presence of several Andavan thiruvadis and named him&#160;&#160;as&#160;&lsquo;Sri RanganAtha mahA dEsikan&rsquo;&#160;and&#160;&#160;asrama disciples&#160;&#160;fondly called&#160;&#160;him&#160;&#160;as Thembarai Andavan. Both Acharyas, namely Akkur Andavan and his successor Srimath&#160;&#160;Thembarai Andavan were together in the Asramam for a period of 5-1/2months till&#160;&#160;Srimath Akkur Andavan&#160;&#160;adorned ThirunAdu on 19-3-1947 on a krishna paksha dwAdasi day (in the month of Panguni, viya year).</p>

Srimath Thembarai Andavan Sri RanganAtha MahA dEsikan&#160;&#160;adorned Acharya peetam as the 8th Andavan in the Andavan Periashramam Munithraya Sampradayam AchArya Lineage. .<br />
&#160;&#160;Thembarai is a beautiful serene village situated on the banks of river pAmani .He was born to Sri. U.Ve. Vangeepuram SeshAdriyAchAr in then year 1886 VIYA varusham in the month of Avani with Revathy as birth star(19-08-1886).His poorvasirama name was venkataraghavan. (His father gave him excellent education in his younger days.)<br />
&#160;&#160;The Astrologers who looked at the horoscope of swAmi predicted that he would become a sanyAsi and a parama virakthA,unparalleled. After undergoing samskArams at the right age, swAmi performed adhyayanam of sAma sAkhA and became an exponent. He underwent rigorous training and mastered sanskrit, and Kavya sAstrAs along with other vEda sAkhAs in Thirukkudanthai Sanskrit College. He went to Rajamannar koil&#160;&#160;nd mastered vyAkaraNa sAstrAs under the tutelage of Sri. U.Ve. RangachAr swAmi (This mahAn later became the 39th Jeer of Sri Ahobila Mutt as Sri Parankusa SatakOpa yatheendra mahA dEsikan). Later he went to viLAkkudi to learn tharka sAstrAs under the eminent guidance of &ldquo;ThArkika simham&rdquo; Sri. U.Ve. SrinivAsachariAr swAmi. Having completely learnt tharka sAstrAs, swAmi learnt and mastered MeemAmsa sAstrAs under the guidance of MahA mahOpAdhyAyA Brahmasri KuppuswAmi SastrigAL and Brahmasri ChinnaswAmi SastrigAL.<br />
&#160;<br />
Marriage<br />
In the year 1908, swAmi was married to Srimathi Vijayavalli Ammal. Immediately after the marriage, swAmi took the VaisvadEva upadEsam from his paternal uncle, Maha vidwAn Brahmanidhi Sri. U.Ve. RamabhadrAchAr swAmi. During his GruhasthAsramA, swAmi observed panca kAla anushtAnams in an austere and rigorous way. Later, swAmi served as a religious teacher in a national high school. . During this time swAmi served as an examiner for sanskrit competitions conducted Sri kanchi kAmakOti matam. Sri SankarAchArya (paramAchAryA) had utmost respect for swAmi&rsquo;s pAndithyAm.&#8232;&#8232;SwAmi followed Sriman nigamAntha mahA dEsikan in observing &lsquo;Unccha vrutthi&rsquo;. Such was the vairAghyam swAmi possessed in renouncement all the materialistic lifestyle and observance of severe austerity. c.. SwAmi underwent grantha chathushtya kAlakshEpams under Srimath NammAndavan. In the kAlakshEpa goshti, swAmi used to listen to kAlakshEpam with rapt attention and full concentration.&#8232;Srimath NammAndavan performed panca samskAram to swAmi in his younger days and later performed bharasamarpanam at the lotus feet of vaduvoor (Lord Sri Rama). In the year 1922, in Mannargudi,Sri Ramanaya upanyasam of swAmi was arranged by Sri. U.Ve. vidwAn Rama swAmi Iyengar and Sri. U.Ve. KrishnamAchAriAr,which went on for over two months.&#8232;While swAmi was undertaking kAlakshEpams from His Holiness Srimath NammAndavan ,Srimath Andavan adorned ThirunAdu unexpectedly in Kanchipuram. Srimath Akkur Andavan succeeded NammAndavan to adorn the AchArya peetam. Thembarai swAmi continued his kAlakshEpams under Srimath Akkur Andavan.<br />
&#8232;Guna seelA&#8232;From his younger days, swAmi was a puritan filled with all satva gunAs .. Simplicity, honesty, purity, veracity, courage, equality, renunciation, lucid and profound&#8232;sampradayic knowledge were hallmarks of swAmi&rsquo;s gunAs. One could see simplicity all the way in the clothes he wore, the food he ate or the lifestyle he led. SwAmi was such a down-to-earth person who won the respect of many of his admirers SwAmi had no desire to save money for his family. The amazing virakthi swAmi possessed is attributed to his profound knowledge of our siddhAnta and total belief in it. Even during the sadas when sambhavana was offered to vidwAns, swAmi would do his best to avoid taking up sanmAnam.&#8232;&#8232;SanyAsa sweekAram&#8232;Swami was doing kainkaryam to Srimath Akkur Andavan, continuing to undertake kAlakshEpams under His Holiness. Srimath Andavan was immensely pleased with our swAmi&rsquo;s GnAna, vairAghyA and AnushtAnams and felt that our swami was the right person to be adorned as &lsquo;sampradAya pravarthakA&rsquo; of periAsramam after His time.HE WAS very&#160;&#160;confident our swami would carry Asramam&rsquo;s growth to heights of glory. Accordingly HH did upadEsam on prapatti proyOgA and prEsha manthram to our swami.&#8232;&#8232;In the meantime, swAmi&rsquo;s dharma patni attained AchAryan thiruvadi in the year 1946. Srimath Akkur Andavan was also becoming weak because of age.&#160;&#160;Swami after long thoughts decided to take up sanyAsam and hence went to Srimath Andavan and prayed to HH and sought his blessings for the sanyAsam. Srimath Andavan was extremely pleased by swAmi&rsquo;s decision and ordained His sishyAs to make arrangements for the Holy ceremony.&#8232;&#8232;In the year viya in the month of Aippasi on the 21st&#160;day i.e. on 6-10-1946 in the presence of several Andavan Thiruvadis, Srimath Akkur Andavan gave the holy sanyAsam to Sri. U.Ve. Brahmaniddhi Thembarai VenkatarAghavAchAriar swami. He was given the title as &lsquo;Sri RanganAtha mahA dEsikan&rsquo; and was fondly called as Thembarai Andavan. Srimath Akkur Andavan lived for 5 more months after that and adorned ThirunAdu on 19-3-1947 on a krishna paksha dwAdasi day ( in the month of Panguni, viya year).<br />
&#160;<br />
Because of the sanyAsa sweekAram, swami's lifestyle did not change a bit at all as he practiced a life of sanyAsi even before that with rigorous anushtAnams and extreme vairAghyam having completely renounced worldly comforts.&#8232;The daily chores of Asramam was maintained the same way as it was done from Srimath PeriAndavan's period. Srimath Thembarai Andavan would wake up before 4 AM in the morning and would perform avagAha snAnam immediately thereafter. SandhyAvandhanam, japams would be done after that followed by bhagavath ArAdhanam and purvAchAryAs' pAdukA ArAdhanam. This was followed by distribution of perumAl and pAdukA theertham. . Later, Sri bhAshya, geethA bhAshya, bhagavath vishaya kAlakshEpams would by rendered by His Holiness after which vaidheeka karmas such as samAsrayanams and bharanyAsams would be performed for the bhAgavathAs for the day.<br />
&#8232;In the evenings, kAlakshEpams on divya sookthis such as Srimath RamAyanam, nyAya siddhAnjanam. AdhikaraNa sArAvaLi would happen besides other anushtAnams. Srimath Andavan would consume very little food once a day in the mornings.<br />
&#8232;During swAmi's time as AchAryA, Sri. U.Ve. Chakravarthi KrishnamAchAriar swAmi, Sri. U.Ve. V.K. SrinivAsAchAriAr swami and later Sri. U.Ve. SrinivAsa rAghavAchariAr swami ( Kannan swami &ndash; later Srimath Thirukkudanthai Andavan) served as Sri Karyams of Asramam at different periods.<br />
&#8232;As per the holy order of His Holiness, a monthly magazine called 'Sri Ranganatha Paduka' was started in the year 1955 in the month of October ( Manmatha Varusham in the month of Ippasi) to bring a connection between the asramam and the andavan sishyas.&#8232;&#8232;Srimath Thembarai Andavan became weaker as the days passed by due to rigorous anushtanams, meagre intake of food and also due to breathing related health issues.

&#160;Srimath Thirukkudanthai Andavan: Thirunakshatram: Panguni - Pushyam<br />
&#160;Thanian:<br />
Srimath vedhantha ramanuja munikarunalabdha vedhantha&#160;yugmam&#8232;Srimath Srivasa yogeeswara gurupadhayorarpithaswathma&#160;bharam&#8232;Srimath Sri ranganathahvaya munikrupaya praptha&#160;mokshasramam tham&#8232;Srimath Vedhantha ramanuja munimaparam samsraye&#160;desikendram&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Given below is the history of&#160;&#160;&#160;Srimath Thirukkudanthai Andavan &ndash; Srivedantha ramanuja maha desikan,who took Srirangam&#160;Srimath Andavan periAsramam to glorious&#160;&#160;heights of growth spreading it literally across length and breadth of&#160;the country.&#8232;&#8232;Avataram&#8232;Srimath Thirukkudanthai Andavan was in the born in a&#160;small village&#160;&#160;called&#160; &ldquo; karukudi&rdquo; (situated next to&#160;Thirukkandiyur in Tanjore district) in the banks of&#160;river Kaveri in the&#160;&#160;Parabhava year - Panguni month &ndash;with&#160;&#160;pushyam as his birth&#160;&#160;star -( 1907) to Sri. U.Ve.&#160;Padmanabhachariar and Komalavalli devi. He was named as &ldquo;Srinivasaraghavan&rdquo; He was fondly called by everybody as &lsquo;Kannan&rdquo;.&#8232;&#8232;Kannan swami was taken to Srirangam periAsramam many a&#160;times by his father during His childhood days. He used&#160;to observe the paduka Aradhanam being performed there&#160;and when he came back to kudanthai, he will play with&#160;&#160;friends of his age posing himself as an acharya, wearing a cloth up to knee height and will have a&#160;dhandam in his hand and proclaim himself as Andavan.&#160;He will carry the water in &ldquo;kottankacchi&rdquo; &ndash; a dried&#160;coconut shell ( Srirangam periAsramam is also called&#160;kottankacchi Asramam) and distribute the &ldquo;theertham&rdquo; in the same way Srimath thErezhundur Andavan used to&#160;do ( focusing both His eyes in one direction). He will&#160;do all this with out the knowledge of his father.&#8232;&#8232;Sri Padmanabhachar swami taught him the&#160;arulicheyalgals of Alwars &ndash; Nalayira divya prabhandham&#160;at a tender age and swami mastered&#160;&#160;the tamil vedham , before he completed 14 years. He also&#160;learnt sAstras in Kottaiyur , under the tutelage of Sri. Seshasayee&#8232;Sri padmanabhachAr swami sent his son to Raja patasala&#160;in Kamakshi josyar street for some time to learn more&#160;on sastras. Later swami learnt&#160;tharka,and&#160;&#160;meemamsa,vyakarana sastras under shri devanagar vilagam swami&#160;. He&#160;stood as a paragon, gaining extensive knowledge in all&#160;the sastras&#160;&#160;.&#160;He also qualified for&#160;Sanskrit Sironmani fromThiruvaiyaru Sanskrit college.&#160;Whenever Nammandavan and Engalandavan visited&#160;Thirukkudanthai in their respective times, Sri Kannan&#160;swami performed kalakshepams on adhyatma sastras under their lotus feet. One of those times, Srimath&#160;Engalandavan performed &ldquo;Bhara samarpanam&rdquo; to Sri&#160;Kannan swami in Amudhan sannidhi.&#160;Swami had been performing kainkaryam to divya desam&#160;perumals even much before becoming Andavan.<br />
&#160;<br />
Life as a Gruhasta&#8232;By the age of 14, swami having mastered the whole of Divya prabhadham became a leading member in the&#160;adhyapaka ghosti.&#160;&#160;At the age of 16, He got&#160;married to Sri vedavalli ammal. She was the sixth&#160;daughter of Neduntheru krishnaswamy Iyengar. For his&#160;livelihood, swami started giving upanyasams at a very&#160;young age.&#8232;&#8232;Swami used to visit Tanjore , every&#160;Sunday to render kalakshepams on Geetha Bhashyam.&#8232;&#160;Four sons and two daughters were born to swami in his gruhasthasramam.&#160;After his father&rsquo;s demise,&#160;swami with the blessings of his Acharya, went&#160;&#160;to Chennai to take care of his family needs.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
Move to Chennai&#8232;When swami went to chennai, Akkur varadachar swami, an ardent devotee of sreemad Akkur Andavan,and a great business magnet ,&#160;requested Him to stay in his thirumaligai and arranged&#160;&#160;for swami&rsquo;s rendering of kalakshepams in various&#160;sabhas through out the city.&#8232;&#8232;Kannan swami had His own distinct and inimitable style&#160;of rendering upanyasam. It simply mesmerized the&#160;listeners who were always seeking more at the end of&#160;His upanyasams. At that time His contemporaries in&#160;upanyasams were stalwarts such as karppangadu&#8232;venkatachariar swami, kanchi vidwan prathivadhi&#160;bhayankaram Annangarachariar swami.&#8232;As a parent, Swami performed his duties very well by&#160;giving good education to his children and led his&#160;gruhastasrama in a blessed manner&#8232;&#8232;<br />
His Acharya Bhakti which was so deep rooted in his&#160;heart prompted him to visit Srirangam several times to&#160;seek the blessings of Srimath Thembarai Andavan. Srimath Thembarai Andavan,seeing his Acharya bhakthi&#160;not only ordained him to look after the administration&#160;affairs of the Asramam ( by appointing him as Sri&#160;karyam of the Asramam) but also commanded Him to stay&#160;permanently in Srirangam.<br />
&#160;<br />
In 1963, Srimath Thembarai Andavan became very weak&#160;and emaciated due to strict Ahara niyamams and old age&#160;and wanted to nominate His successor to adorn the&#160;Acharya peetam. Sri Kannan swami who&#160;&#160;had&#160;&#160;unassuming Acharya bhakthi,&#160;&#160;rigorous observance ofanushtanams, and&#160;great administrative skills immediately came to his&#160;mind. This very thought made Srimath Andavan feel&#160;happy and His Holiness apprised Sri kannan swami about this and was optimistic that Sri Kannan&#160;swami would oblige.&#160;&#160;<br />
&#160;<br />
Taking up sanyasam&#8232;Srimath Thembarai Andavan became weaker as the days&#160;passed by. So His Holiness gave upadesam on &ldquo;Preksha&#160;manthram&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mokshasrama Ahnika Anushtanam&rdquo; to&#160;three vidwans of the Asramam - U.Ve. Sri. Kannan&#160;swami(the incumbent for the succession,) U.Ve. Sri. Mysore GopalachAr swami( who later&#160;on became Srimath Mysore Andavan in the year 1988) and&#160;&#160;Mannargudi Ganapadi vidwAn U.Ve. Sri. Narasimhacharya&#160;swami , to be ready and take up sanyasam any&#160;time when called.<br />
&#160;<br />
When swami was in chennai, Srimath Andavan&rsquo;s niyamanam&#160;&#160;kept on occurring to his mind and&#160;&#160;swami&#160;&#160;appeared to be reluctant in&#160;&#160;taking up sanyasam due to&#160;family circumstances.,.<br />
&#160;Sri. Kannan swami&rsquo;s son,&#160;Sri.&#160;Gopalan told his father that he had dreamt about&#160;Srimath Thembarai Andavan telling him that He had gone&#160;to viraja nadhi and come back and asked him to send his&#160;father immediately and take up sanyasam. GopAlan also&#160;told his father that he would take care of his mother&#160;(swami's dharma pathni) and asked him to proceed to&#160;Srirangam. Sri Kannan swamy&#160;&#160;finally decided to&#160;&#160;prepare&#160;&#160;himself for sanyasam and accept Srimath&#160;Thembarai Andavan&rsquo;s Niyamanam.<br />
&#160;<br />
On April 4th 1963, Srimath Andavan's condition became&#160;worse Sree&#160;karyam Sri. U.Ve. kannan swami was informed of&#160;Srimath Andavan&rsquo;s health and immediately kannan swamy&#8232;rushed up to Srirangam. On His arrival, arrangements&#160;were speeded up for His thureeyasrama sweekaram.&#8232;&#8232;Early morning the next day i.e. on 5th april, 1963&#160;(Friday, sukla dwadasi, makam star), in the presence&#160;of sishyas, His Holiness Srimath Thembarai Andavan&#160;ordained the ascetic order to Sri U.Ve. Kannan Swami&#160;who was named as Srimath Vedanta Ramanuja maha&#8232;Desikan and within few&#160;hours on the same day (April 5th 1963) Tembarai Andavan adorned&#160;&#160;Thirunadu .&#8232;&#8232;This illustrious Acharya Peetam of Srimath Andavan,developed centrally on His Holiness Thirukkudanthai&#160;Srimath Andavan vedantha ramanuja maha desikan.&#8232;&#8232;He was a great scholar in Nyaya, Vyakarana, and so&#160;much he was at ease in the recitals of Nalayira Divya&#160;Prabhandham, Srimath Ramayanam, Bhagavath Vishayam and&#160;sukthis, Having taken to ascetic order,&#160;&#160;&#160;casting away plentitude of wealth , this great Acharya had assimilated in&#160;himself extreme, rigid and rigorous life of a sanyasi, the strict austerity and highly puritan life&#160;of his predecessors scorning all luxuries.&#8232;&#8232;Sancharam&#8232;Poorvacharyas like Sri Periandavan, Sri Nammandavan&#160;and Sri Akkoor Andavan went by padayatra to places&#160;such as Melkote,&#160;Mysore&#160;, Kanchi, Ariyakkudi,sethu.&#160;Srimath Andavan covered over 30000 km by foot from&#160;sethu to Himachalam through out the length and the&#8232;breadth of the country and set up various Asramams in&#160;places very far away from&#160;South India&#160;.&#8232;&#8232;During His time, Srimath Andavan Asramam grew leaps&#160;and bounds throughout the country. This was truly a&#160;golden period in the annals of the Asramam as it&#160;witnessed itself a phenomenal growth and a meteoric&#160;rise. His Holiness constructed many Asramams&#8232;throughout the country during His period and also&#160;conducted many Temple samprokshanams,Yagnams, Homams&#160;and performed mangalasasanams of various Divya desams,&#160;Vijaya yathras from Kanniyakumari to Badrinath and&#160;held Many Vidvath Sadas to name a few.&#8232;&#8232;Srimath Andavan observed 26 chathurmasyams spanning 26&#160;years from 1963 to 1989 and reached Thirunadu on Vibhava varusham &ndash;panguni madham-Krishna panjami day (10-04-1989) leaving behind thousands of grieving disciples&#160;and admirers, whose divine anubhavams with His&#160;Holiness during His life time remain carved&#160;&#160;in their&#160;memory forever.&#8232;&#8232;In the next posting&#160;adiyen will continue with the history&#160;of acharyas beginning with Srimath&#160;Mysore Andavan.<br />

September&#160;&#160;issue of&#160;&#160;2004,(Dharana varsusham &ndash;Purattasi madham)<br />
&#160;as a life history of Kaviratna, Vedanta Vibhushana, Vedantasara, Pravachana Kalanidhi, Sri U Ve Vidwan Hariharapuram Gopalacharya (in his purvAsramA) and as Srimath Mysore Andavan, Sri Srinivasa Ramanuja Mahadesikan ( in ThuriyAsramA).<br />
&#160;&#160;An elderly scholar of vidwat scholarship in Sanskrit, Tamil, Kannada and Hindi,&#160;Sri Hariharapuram&#160;Gopalacharya was born on 19.08.1909 ( Soumya&#160;&#160;Varusham &ndash;Avani Madham Uthira Palguni Nakshathram)&#160;to Sri Krishnamaachaarya and Smt. Ranganaayakamma (Gowri festival day, Sosale village, T. Narasipura Taluk on the banks of Cauvery near Sangamam of Cauvery and Kapila rivers, Mysore district) who belonged to an orthodox Srivaishnava family which had a scholastic background. Other members of the family included two brothers and two sisters.<br />
&#160;&#160;During his childhood, due to epidemic plague that spread widely, swAmi's father passed away, following which, the family's financial position was not sound. He lived in Sosale village and studied in a higher primary school there. Knowing the budding scholar in swAmi, the scholars persuaded him to join Mysore Maharaja Samskruta Paathashaala and continue his studies. Accordingly, swAmi came to Mysore, joined the Sanskrit college, completed his further studies in Saahitya and Vyaakarana and became Vidwan.&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;During the student days, he had to depend for his daily food in Sri Parakaala mutt, where the then Aacharya Sri Abhinava Ranganaatha parakAla mahA dEsikan who adorned the peetam, noticed the brilliant boy and provided him necessary facilities. By the grace of lord Hayagreeva, he also brought his brothers and used to help them by giving good education and food (padi) that he received in the Parakaala mutt and there by facilitated their studies also.<br />
&#160;&#160;Having completed matriculation, Sanskrit (vidwat degree), Kannada Pandit and Hindi Pandit exams, he attained proficiency in 'Naalaayira Divyaprabhandam' (Tiruvaymozhi), chanting of vedas, literature and grammar. He passed all higher examinations of philosophy (Vedanta Shastra) and obtained Vidwat Prashasti.&#160;&#160;In his 14th year, he had the blessings of Srimath NammAndavan and with Pancha Samskaaras and Bharanyasa. At that juncture, he composed a beautiful collection of 134 poems (Srimad Aandavan Vaibhavam) and visualizing the scholar in him, Srimad Aandavan blessed the boy immensely and he came to be known as Mysore Vidwan Gopu.<br />
&#160;&#160;Regarding discharging duties and responsibilities, Sri Gopaalaachar married Smt Jayalakshmi from Talkad who belonged to a respectable family. The couple were blessed with six daughters and two sons.&#160;<br />
&#160;&#160;Srimath Mysore Andavan was famous amongst the other scholars from Sosale. He worked hard towards the improvement of the&#160;&#160;Sri Venugopalaswamy temple at Sosale. He was an ardent devotee of Srimath Aandavan, all through. He was a beloved disciple of many great scholars and he successfully completed the studies of&#160;&#160;and Upanishads and&#160;&#160;grantha chathushtya kAlakshEpams under Srimath Akkur Andavan<br />
&#160;&#160;In his efforts to invite Srimath&#160;&#160;Aakoor Andavan to Karnataka, his journey on cycle to Chamarajanagar, Sathymangalam, Erode and Srirangam to arrange for the stay of Andavan was commendable. With all these devotional services to Sri Aacharya, he obtained the blessings of Srimath&#160;&#160;Aakoor Aandavan. Sri&#160;&#160;Gopalacharya served in a high school at Sakaleeshpuar (Karnataka) and thereafter he came to Mysore and served as Sanskrit teacher in Mahajana high school (1945 to 1975).<br />
&#160;&#160;Srimath Thembarai Andavan became weaker as the days&#160;passed by,and&#160;&#160;gave upadesam on &ldquo;Preksha&#160;manthram&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mokshasrama Ahnika Anushtanam&rdquo; to&#160;three vidwans of the Asramam - U.Ve. Sri. Kannan&#160;swami(who later became Thirukkudanthai Andavan), U.Ve. Sri. Mysore GopalachAr swami, and&#160;&#160;Mannargudi Ganapadi vidwAn U.Ve. Sri. Narasimhacharya&#160;swami , to be ready and take up sanyasam any&#160;time when called.<br />
&#160;&#160;when the health condition of His holiness Srimad Tembirai Andavan was badly affected,&#160;Vidvan sri Gopalachar Swamy&#160;&#160;was the&#160;&#160;alternate candidate to become ninth peetathipathi to succeed His holiness thebirai Andavan Himself in April 1963,had not sri Kannan swamy turned up for taking up sanyAsam for any reason. Sri kannan swamy entered Thuriyasramam in&#160;&#160;5th&#160;April 1963 as 9th&#160;peetathipathy with the name Srimadh Vedhantha Ramanuja Maha Desikan.(SRP-sep-2004)<br />
&#160;&#160;Sri Chitrakoodam Vijayaraghavachariar was the srikaryam till late 60s.Then, Sri Mysore Gopalachar became Srikaaryam of the Srimad Andavan Ashramam , and continued as srikaryam&#160;&#160;for almost 2 decades. As srikaryam of Srimath Andavan asramam, He travelled&#160;&#160;all along&#160;&#160;with the then pontiff&#160;&#160;H.H.Thirukkudanthai Aandavan, &amp; undertook paadayatra all over India and specially Badrikasramam. He was respected for his devotion, dedication, commitment to Srivaishnavism (Sri Ramanuja Darshanam) and his wide scholarship in all shastras. He was a good swimmer too.<br />

Following his contribution to Sanskrit literature, SwAmi&#160;&#160;was recognized as an outstanding scholar both by state and center, and was given an honorarium (President's Gold Medal).<br />
&#160;&#160;When Srimad Thirukkudanthai Andavan,s health was very much affected ,His holiness gave sanyasam to ,Vidvan Mysore&#160;&#160;Gopalachar&#160;&#160;on 11.04.1988 (PRABHAVA VARUSHAM-PANGUNI MADHAM &ndash;Sravana&#160;Nakshathram) and HH became the successor of Thirukkudanthai Andavan and&#160;&#160;&#160;10 th peetathipathi of Srimadh Srirangam Andavan Ashram&#160;at the . age of 79 years.,Since then he was popularly called as&#160;Mysore Andavan.<br />
&#160;&#160;&ldquo;The health of His holiness was&#160;&#160;also very much affected,in 1988/89 by repeated&#160;&#160;debilitating strokes of cerebral thrombosis .Even then, His holiness used to remember and recite fluently the verses that He composed more than six decades earlier.And yet Padukas<br />
Saw to it that HH Srimad Mysore Andavans&rsquo;s mental faculties &amp; speech were not affected (excepting for a minor loss of recent memories!)When not bedridden, HH could move about freely and perform Perumal and Paduka Aradhanam daily and recite the Seva Kalams fluently (when the senior Acharya Srimad Thirukkudanthai Andavan was too much indisposed to do so.)&#160;&#160;HH&#160;&#160;srimad Mysore Andavan&rsquo;s Kalyana Gunas were many .Indeed a rare combination of of Gnanam Santham ,Virakthi, Vairakyam,and Anagam.(blemish less or Faultless)and above all an un shakeable Acharya Bhakthi that had to be seen to be believed)&#160;&ldquo;(SRP. SEP., 2004)<br />
&#160;&#160;Both the Acharyas,Srimad Thirukkudanthai Andavan and Srimad Mysore Andavan were<br />
together for a period of exactly one year<br />
His holiness&#160;&#160;Srimad Thirukkudanthai Andavan adorned the Thirunadu on 10-04-1989.Within a short period of 42days His holiness Srimad Mysore Andavan also&#160;&#160;attained Paramapadam at Srirangam Ashramam -Dwidhiyai on&#160;&#160;22 -05-1989 ( @ 3:10 AM on a Monday,&#160;&#160;SUKLA VARUSHAM &ndash;VAIKASI&#160;&#160;MADHAM_-Krishna Paksham thithi ) thus&#160;becoming an illustrious ardent devotee of Sri Ramanuja. Words cannot explain the saintly nature of Srimath Mysore Andavan, but it could only be felt by the disciples who loved and adored him with devotion.<br />
With Obeisance&#160;&#160;to His Holiness&#160;&#160;Srimath Andavan, Sri SrinivAsa RAmAnuja mahA DEsikan.<br />

Having&#160;&#160;gained the wealth of&#160;&#160;Sri sampradayic&#160;&#160;knowledge/Ubhaya Vedhanthams&#160;&#160;from his Acharya, he whirrs as a honeybee at His lotus feet. Salutations&#160;to Srimath&#160;&#160;Ranga Ramanuja maha Desikan<br />
&#160;<br />
Prakrutham Srimad Andavan was born in Srimushnam, a swayam vyaktha Kshethra, in south arcot district, on a Vaikasi &ndash;ArudrA day in Yuva varusham&#160;03-06-19&#160;35 to U .Ve. Srinivasachariar and sri Kumudhavalli, belonging to to the illustrious lineage of swayamAchArya purushAs.&#160;His great great grand father Sri Nadu nattu Narayanachar was the prime disciple of annarya Maha Desikan&#160;.The pooravasrama name of Srimushnam Andavan was Varahan. Varahan&rsquo;s, UpanayAthi samskAram were performed at the right age.<br />
&#160;<br />
His father was a disciple of Sangeetha kalanidhi late Tiger Varadhachar swamy. Young Varahan used to sit by the side of his father during those music lessons and assimilated the nuances of Carnatic music to an astonishing degree which enabled Him to sing ragas with mellifluous voice.<br />
&#160;<br />
Sri Varahan swamy became well qualified in vEda and divya prabhanda adhyayanams at an young age. His periappa Sri U.Ve. Srimushnam puranam Narayanachariar taught him kAvya and nAtaka alankarA granthAs. Swamy went to kAkumAni charity pAtasAlA(&#160;affiliated&#160;to&#160;Madras&#160;University&#160;) in Chennai for his initial education in SastrAs.<br />
&#160;<br />
In a quest to learn more about sAmAnya sAstrAs swAmy came to sriperumbudur and learnt fully the nyAya and tharka sAstrAs.&#160;The yong Varaha swamy qualified himself as Tharka sironmani, trained under great teachers in Sriperumbudur Sanskrit patasala like Sri Krishna Desika Thathachariar (father of great N.S.R. swamy) and others. Seeing swamy&rsquo;s remarkable knowledge and extreme brilliance learned wise men who had interacted with swamy at that time, predicted that swamy would become a maHa vidwAn and a sampradhAya pravarthakaA.<br />
&#160;<br />
For some time, swami went to Andhra Pradesh and taught in Sanskrit colleges located in Jeetical and AlwAl, close to Hydrabad. His lucid and brilliant teaching earned a lot of accolades and he learnt to speak and read Telugu very fluently.&#160;Swamy came back to Sriperumbudur and passed in Tamil VidwAn exam and served as Such in Tamilnadu Government educational service for 27 years. He lived in malayangulam for many years and settled down at Velamur, the Birth place of Upanishad Bhashyakkarar H.H. Ranga Ramanuja Maha Desikan.&#160; Sri Varahachar swamy renovated and maintained the temple and performed nithya Aradhanam all by himself for the Divya Dampathies.<br />
&#160;<br />
His Holiness 44th&#160;Jeer of Sri Ahobila Mutt once conferred a special sambavanai appreciating his extra ordinary knowledge, Vidvath and lucid presentation. Sri srimushanam Varahachar, a tamil pandit in Govt Secondary Education service for 27 years&#160;&#160;had His Prapatti under His holiness Thirukkudanthai Andavan and Grantha chathushtya Kalakshepams under His Holiness during the same time.<br />
&#160;<br />
The divine message from Padukas to revered Acharya Thirukkudanthai Andavan was that &ldquo;Srimushnam Varahachariar will be your successor , Rest assured that this Padukasramam so beautifully nurtured by you, will be safe in his hands&#160;&#160;and will reach much greater heights.&rdquo;&#160;&#160;The Acharya directed sri Varahachariar swamy&#160;&#160;that when the time comes he should come forward to protect and preserve the Andavan Asrama Paramparai meaning , that he should become his successor probably knowing in advance that His successor H.H. Mysore Andavan may not live long.<br />
&#160;<br />
Two Great Acharyas attaining Paramapadam in quick succession in April &amp; May 1989,<br />
&#160;H.H.Srimadh Thirukkudanthai Andavan adorned&#160;&#160;ThirunAdu on 10.04.1989<br />
&#160;His successor H.H.Srimad&#160;&#160;Mysore Andavan&#160;&#160;also adorned&#160;&#160;&#160;Thirunadu&#160;&#160;&#160;(within 42 days)&#160;&#160;on 22.05.1989. Lakhs of disciples were worried, over the continuation of Andavan Asrama Acharya&#160;&#160;parampara When the Disciples of the Ashramam approached Sri Varahachar swamy, He had whole heartedly accepted&#160;&#160;the call to the&#160;&#160;religious order though he had a large family to support.<br />
&#160;<br />
Exactly on the 10th&#160;day, i.e.&#160;01-06-1989&#160;, upon the holy command made by H.H. Thirukkudanthai Andavan earlier, Sri Varahachar Swamy with devotion, took ascetic order, by taking the&#160;ochre ascetic robes of sanyasam&#160;from&#160;PeriyAndavan sannadhi&#160;on Sukla Varusham- Vaikasi 19th&#160;as Sri Ranga Ramanuja Maha Desikan, in memory of his affection towards the illustrious Great Acharya from Velamur &ldquo;Sri Upanishad Bhashyakarar&rdquo;- H.H. Sri Ranga Ramanuja Maha Desikan. The disciples of the Asramam got convinced that H.H.Sri Mushnam Srimad Andavan can not only carry aloft the banner of Ashramam&#160;&#160;but also take it to further heights. H.H. is a versatile exponent in many other sAstras such as sculpture , sangeetham, alankAra sAstra, Astrology, Jyothisham, politics, construction,Ayurvedha to name a few. Swamy&rsquo;s pandithyam in VedhanthA and vyAkaranA is well known. It is also well known that His Holiness Srimadh Andavan talks with Slesha in appropriate moments with amazing timing and precision. It could be said that there are no literatures left out in Tamil that swami is unaware of. It is swamy&rsquo;s special quality to quote Thiruvalluvar,Kamban,IlangO and Bharathi in His anugraha Bashanams as and when required.<br />
&#160;<br />
Srimad Andavan once beautifully sculpted a sAlagrAma perumal (which was a little broken) to Lakshmi Hayagreeva Perumal. So many people&#160;&#160;have wondered about His Holiness&rsquo;s amazing knowledge in a wide variety of subjects. Srimadh Andavan is well versed in Telugu also and gives anugraha bhAshanams in that language to sishyas and abhimanis whenever an opportunity arises.&#160;His holiness is a scholar of unfathomable depth in many&#160;&#160;subjects under the sky.<br />

<p>Srirangam Srimath Andavan Ashramam --Guruparampara --Chapter 13<br />
&#160;<br />
Srimathe Ranga Ramanuja Maha Desikaya Namaha&#8232;Sri Ranganatha Divya Mani Padhukabhyam Namaha&#8232;&#8232;<br />
Acharya parampara of Srimath Andavan Ashramam continues in this posting with the second part of Life History of Srimath&#160;Srimushnam Andavan -&#160;Sri&#160;Ranga Ramanuja Mahadesikan.<br />
Srirangam Srimath Andavan Ashramam has been the center for spreading &rdquo;The philosophy of VisistAdvaitA &ldquo; which is a&#160;&#160;very ancient one having come down to us through ages as an unbroken tradition. It has the authority of eternal vEdas, Upanishads, in Sanskrit and Divya Prabhandams in Tamil, as well as the Lord&rsquo;s own words &ldquo;PancharAthra&rdquo;.&#160;&#160;It is the true Philosophy of religion unassailable , dear to Divya dampathis , dear to seers , dear to Alwars and Acharyas.<br />
&#160;<br />
His holiness initiated efforts to spread this message of Srivaishnavism and Prapathi margam founded and propagated by Sri Bhagavath Ramanuja and nurtured by Sri Nigamantha Mahadesika several centuries ago and performed samasrayanam and saranagathi to thousands of sishyas. His Holiness Offered Mangalasasanams to the Divya Dampathis of most of the 108 Divya Desams, imparted Grantha Chathustya Kalakshepams and Anugraha Bhashanams to countless audiences.<br />
&#160;<br />
In Bhagavath Geetha ,<br />
&#160;Chapter7-16 Lord Krishna says to ArjunA<br />
&ldquo;ChathurvidhA&#160;&#160;bhajanthE mAm janA:&#160;&#160;&#160;sukruthinOrjunA<br />
ArthO&#160;&#160;&#160;jignAsurarthArthi&#160;&#160;&#160;GnAni cha&#160;&#160;bharatharshabha;&rdquo;<br />
&#160;<br />
(Four types of devotees of noble deeds worship me<br />
&#160;<br />
1. The seeker after worldly possession,<br />
2. afflicted,<br />
3. the seeker of knowledge, and&#160;<br />
4.man of&#160;wisdom, Gnani, oh, best of Bharathas)<br />
&#160;<br />
&#160;Chap 7-17<br />
ThEsham&#160;&#160;&#160;Gnani nithyayuktha Eka bhakthir vishishyathE<br />
PriyO hi GnaninOthyartham&#160;&#160;aham&#160;&#160;cha mama priya:<br />
&#160;<br />
(Of these, the best is man of wisdom (Gnani) ever established in identity with me and possessed exclusive devotion for me , I am extremely dear to&#160;Gnani,&#160;&#160;and gnani&#160;is extremely dear to me)<br />
&#160;<br />
Acharyas are Gnanis&#160;, who are dearer to God.&#160;&#160;Acharyas dispel the darkness of mind and enlighten with knowledge for which even God himself cannot find substitute as repayment,for the matchless upakaram the Acharya has done, as quoted by Swamt Desikan in &ldquo;Yetri manathezhil&rdquo; in 38th&#160;pasuram of Adhikara Sangraham.Praising Acharya&rsquo;s glory retaining Acharyas teachings in mind, and spreading AcharyAs greatness etc. are only very very small and insignificant, when compared to the greatest help,&#160;&#160;the&#160;&#160;Acharya has done to the sishya earlier.<br />
&#160;<br />
It is our purva janma punyam that we have our Acharya to guide us in the righteous path to spread the fragrance of Arulicheyals and Divya sukthis of Alwars and purvacharyas and philosophy of Visihtadvaita, tarvelling far and wide throughout the country.Sishyas and Abhimanis living abroad in USA UK, Middle east, Singapore and Australia are blessed by His Tele &ndash;Upanyaasams every month for the last 6 years. His holiness is a Charismatic mentor, and his soulabyam, souselyam and His impartiality etc. won the appreciation of several thousands of his sishyas.<br />
&#160;<br />

&#160;<br />

&#160;<br />
