<p style="text-align: center; color: black">Sreemathe Sri Varaha Mahadesikaya Namaha</p>
<p style="text-align: center; color: black">Sreemathe RangaRamanuja Mahadesikaya Namaha&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center; color: black">Sri Paduka Vihara Bhavanam, Anna Nagar West, Chennai 600040</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: black">This centre is developed as an extension of Srirangam Srimath Anadavan Ashramam in the western suburb of Chennai, by Srimath Andavan Sri RangaRamanuja Mahadesikan.</p>
<p style="color: black">This is located in the residential property of&nbsp; Pudukkottai Sri Nallan Chakravarthi R. Srinivasan, at plot number 1557, 17<sup>th</sup> Main Road, Anna Nagar west, 600040.</p>
<p style="color: black">First floor of this property of about 1600 sq. ft is dedicated to Srimath Andavan Ashramam activities. There is a big hall of over 600 sq.ft, which hosted Upanyasams from leading Ubaya Vedantha Vidwans, conducted as per the guidance of Srimath Andavan. In the initial stages support and encouragement given by U.Ve. Sri Sridhara Thathachariar. Sri Krishnaswamy Iyengar and the then Srikaryam Swamy of Andavan Ashramam Sri U.Ve. Madhavachariar were major sources of strength in the development of this centre.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Upanyasa Centre</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">Originally this place was called as Upanyasa Centre only. Sri Paduka Vihara Bhavanam name, meaning &ldquo;&rdquo;the cradle for playing by Padukas&rdquo;&rdquo;, was given by Srimath Andavan during His camp in 1993-4. For nearly 12 years, Upanyasakars nominated by Srimath Andavan Sri RangaRamanuja Mahadesikan,have given discourses on</p>
<ol style="color: black">
<li>Tiruppavai,</li>
<li>Srimath Ramayanam&nbsp; and</li>

<p style="color: black">This upanyasa Centre has been the most sought after by Upanyasakars, as the conduct of this has the blessings of Srimath Andavan, and in western suburb of Chennai city this has become very popular from devotees.</p>

<p style="color: black">Sri A L Narasimhan of Pon Vilaintha Kalathur is an ardent propagator of Swamy Desikan's Sri Paduka Sahasram. He has done voluntarily at several placesm classes on Sri Paduka Sahasram and expressed his desire to do the same for the benefit of Anna nagar devotees. He conducted classes for 2 days a week and completed the full lessons here, explaining the meanings of all slokas. Many devotees participated enthusiastically and also attended a test at the end of the course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Roll of friends and well wishers</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">Organising such major events require the support of closely participating friends and well wishers.

The list includes several ladies , who regularly attended the upanyasams as well Srimath Andavan camping days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Nithya Aradanam</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">Srimath Andavan Sri RangaRamanuja Mahadesikan has nurtured the development of this centre into a prominent Sri Vaishnava Kendram in the west Madras neighbourhood.</p>
<p style="color: black">H.H has camped here almost every year, particularly on His return journey from north India tour, before reaching Alwarpet. There used to be a saying that whenever he needs a peaceful stay away from crowded city Ashramam, he preferred to camp in Anna Nagar, Such is the affinity He had shown.</p>
<p style="color: black">During His stay, nithya Perumal and Paduka aradanams were held, Theertha prasadams were obtained by devotees. Immediately after this Gadya thrayam and Sri Paduka Sahasram Parayanam were held. Many sishyas had their Samasrayanam and Bharanyasam done by H.H.</p>
<p style="color: black">Devotees around this place requested for Dolai as well as Ponnadi by H H.&nbsp; Mangalasasanam of nearby temples were also done, during His camp here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: black">During the camping of Srimath Andavan,&nbsp; Ashramam Trustees, Sri Eytex Rajagopal, Sri G Rangachariar, Sri Upendran, Sri Godha Rangan, Sri A G Ranganathan enthusiatically participated. Sri S Vasudevan was closely associated with this centre from the beginning and was a great support during all Camps of Srimath Andavan in this centre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: black">First ever visit to this house happened in the year 1992, at which time Srimath Andavan made only Paadha Sancharam. H H walked all the way from His previous camping place in Adyar&nbsp; nearly 18 Kms. H H was given a rousing reception at the start of Anna Nagar, near Round Tana with two temple umbrellas accompanying and nathaswaram. Only after a couple of years later, considering His health conditions, we, the sishyas persuaded Him to take Van for Sancharams, which He reluctantly agreed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Audio recordings</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">Srimath Andavan in His own Thirvaakku recorded various Sri Sooktees like Sri Alavandar's Stotra ratnam, Sri Ramanuja's Gadya thrayam, Swami Desikan's Stotrams, including Paduka Sahasram and Sri Valmiki's Sundara Kandam. All these were recorded in Sri Paduka Vihara Bhavanam, during his camp in this location. Sri Vasudevan's son gave a helping hand in recoding all these works.After recording, these were made in audio cassettes,which were then later converted into audio CDs . These were made available for sale through Ashramam.</p>
<p style="color: black">All these H H renderings were uploaded in Ashramam web site <a href="./audio.html">here</a>, which had a wider circulation and well received by devotees.</p>
<p style="color: black">Ashramam's very important event: Former Srikaryam Swamy Sri Madavacahariar made his exit from Ashramam by handing over all Ashramam keys, records and properties at this Sri Paduka Vihara Bhavanam to H.H., Sri RangaRamanuja Mahadesikan, during his camp here.</p>

<p style="color: black"><strong>Villivakkam Ashramam Koil</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">This koil is an offshoot of Sri Paduka Vihara Bhavanam.</p>
<p style="color: black">Original owner of this temple Sri Veerapuaram Krishnamachariar has given dicourses in this Upanyasa Centre on Tiruppavai, Srimad Ramayanam and Srimath Bhagavatam under the nomination of Srimath Andavan. In his old age, nearing 90, he wanted to transfer the temple originated by him, to a party, who will administer it in future, as his poor health is not permitting. He approached me on this and I gave a suggestion to transfer it to Andavan Ashramam, which he readily accepted. His Holiness took some time to accept this and after that H H took charge fully, organised renovation work. Funds were mobilised and Mahasamprokshanam was performed in the year 2013 Thai maasam Pushya Nakshatram ,by Sri Yamunachariar Swamy, (who is now the present Andavan Swamigal after Srimushnam Andavan) . This temple has the sambandam of both the Andavan Swamigals. Sri Paduka Vihara Bhavanam has played a roll in this development.</p>
<p style="color: black">Picture gallery of this temple Samprokshanam can be viewed in our Ashramam web site <a href="./photoalbum.html">here</a>,&nbsp;as a slide show</p>
<p style="color: black">Visit of other SriVaishanava Yathees in Padka Vihara Bhavanam.</p>
<ol style="color: black">
<li>Ahobila Mutt Jeer Srimath Villivalam Swamy, visited the house and performed&nbsp; Dolothsavam&nbsp; of Sri Malola Kannan</li>
<li>Parakala Mutt Jeer also visited the house with Ponnadi</li>
<li>Pictures taken on these occasions appear in the web site <a href="./photoalbum.html">here</a></li>
</ol>
<p style="color: black">With the niyamanam of Srimath Andavan, Andavan website was started nearly 20years back, that is the start of Internet facility in India.&nbsp;This has the wealth of information about Ashramam, but can't say it is complete. Continuous updates are not happeing in this, as nowadays, Ashramam Whatsupp groups are very active and uptodate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: black">In the recent additions to the website are the massive amount of photographs which are all taken during various upanyasams in this centre over a 12 year period. These are displayed as a slide show in the website <a href="./photoalbum.html">here.</a>&nbsp;These will be in the memory of all those who attended at that time. Nearly 400 photographs are there for you to enjoy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: black"><strong>Saalkkinaru renovation </strong></p>
<p style="color: black">In the same website picture gallery, you can enjoy views of the famous Saalakkinaru of Sri Ramanuja's fame. All of you are aware that Srimath Andavan wanted to do the same kainkaryam, which Sri Ramanuja done nearly 1000 years back. H.H nominated a person to fetch Theertam from the same well, which is located near Sevilimedu for Sri Deva perumal Tiruvaaraadanam. But the person by name Sri Narasimhan, had faced difficulties in feching a good and clean water, as the place around the well was dirty due to close by slums in that area. He and one Sri Thallam Ravi approached me to do a renovation work on the well, cleaning and plastering etc., and making foolproof barricades, so that outsiders do not spoil the water. With the niyamanam of Srimath Andavan,this work was carried out. At the same time, we planned to do a compound wall around the well, with iron gates . Since this is a temple property, we made a request to the then E.O. of HR&amp;CE to permit us to do the work, which he agreed. On completion of work, E O along with temple Maniagar , Sri Sampath made a visit and approved the construction work done. Now the well is very safe with a lock and key and is under Ashramam's hold, to fetch water even today, in fulfillment of Sri Ramanuja's wish. You may see inside, a commemeration plaque is kept thst the work was undertaken by Sri Srinivasan and his family members under the niyamanam of Srimath Andavan. Later, as an improvement, flooring work with cement was also carried, to prevent growth of bushes around the well. The then Ashramam Manager Sri Thathachariar&nbsp; gave all the help required on this project.</p>
<p style="color: black">During one of his Camp in Kanchipuram, H H made a visit to this Saalakkinaru and the nearby Sri Ramanuja's Temple and expressed His happiness on the work done.</p>
<p style="color: black">You may have a look at these events <a href="./photoalbum.html">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: black">Srimath Andavan is continuing the service even today of nominating a kainkaryabarar to fetch water everyday for Sri Deva Perumal Nitya Aradanam</p>
<p style="color: black">Kanchipuram Ashramam cum Veda Patasala ( New Complex )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: black">Old Ashramam buildings needed demolition and a new complex work has been entrusted to Adiyen by Srimath Andavan with all proper permissions . A new Patasala premises has been built in a year's time. Srimath Andavan entrusted the Grihapravesam work also to Adiyen to perform. The new building is now serving Ashramam's needs with comfortable living space and very useful at the time of Srimath Andavan's camp in Kanchipuram.</p>
